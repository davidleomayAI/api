**Status**: living document. Last revised 2026-09-17 (`GET /trust-chain` requires a member Bearer session; public graph uses at most one incoming kind per subject: the oldest eligible sibling (`createdAt` then `id`); eligible `verify`, `moderator_appoint`, and `moderator_propose` only when the subject is a moderator; `moderator_confirm` never; later appoint/confirm/propose do not replace the first eligible contact; owner `notificationLevel` on GET `/me` and `POST /me/notification-level`; fan-out filters in-app and Web Push by `all` / `active` / `mentions`; GET `/notifications` lists stored rows unfiltered, including `moderator_appointed`; a zap that inserts a gift-reply fans out only `notifyZap`, not a second `forum_reply`; gift-reply row still lands in the thread; confirm/appoint notify the subject only with `moderator_appointed` and Web Push url `/welcome`).

## Implemented HTTP surface (normative)

Auth state uses `InMemoryAuthStore` when `DATABASE_URL` is unset (tests and
local boots). When `DATABASE_URL` is set, the process migrates the auth
schema and uses `PostgresAuthStore` — accounts, passkey challenges,
passkey credentials, sessions, and pending address verifications survive a
restart. `account.linking_key` is nullable for passkey-created rows. A missing or unreachable
database URL that is set is fail-loud at boot. On the SQL path,
`NOSTR_NSEC_KEK` (64 lowercase hex) is also required; missing or malformed
KEK throws at boot. Public gift statistics
(`GET /gifts/stats` and `GET /gifts?day=`) read the `gift` table when `DATABASE_URL` is set;
without it the process still boots and returns empty stats. Amounts are
also expressed as BTC and historical USD using the UTC-calendar-day
BTC-USD daily close from Coinbase Exchange (persisted in `btc_usd_daily`),
plus additive CHF/EUR/PHP (USD × that UTC day's Frankfurter ECB rate,
persisted in `usd_fiat_daily`; last business day if the market is closed).
GET fetches Coinbase only for missing gift days, UTC-today when `fetched_at`
is older than one hour, and a past day whose `fetched_at` is still on that
same UTC calendar day (intraday print not yet the settled close). Settled
stored days are not re-fetched. A missing BTC-USD rate after ensure/fetch is
**503**. A missing CHF/EUR/PHP cross is JSON `null`, never 503.

Lightning Address verification HTTP routes are implemented. A live
verification payment requires an injected invoice payer; the default
`UnconfiguredInvoicePayer` makes start verification return **503**. Public
`GET /lightning-address` resolves LUD-16 metadata with an in-memory cache; it
does not fetch or pay invoices.

Spend-worker invoice routes (`GET /invoices/passkey`, `GET /invoices/posted`,
`POST /invoices`, `POST /invoices/proof`) check passkey eligibility and a live
**top-level** forum post, fetch a BOLT11 via LNURL-pay, and accept a preimage proof. Issue
requires a passkey-backed account for the address and at least one live **top-level** forum
message that is not the auto-created profile note. Replies do not count. They require `SPEND_API_TOKEN`;
when it is unset the
routes return **503** and the process still boots. This service does not pay
invoices (no LNDHub client). A matching proof inserts an outbound row into
`gift` when `DATABASE_URL` is set (no-op without it) so `GET /gifts/stats` and
`GET /gifts?day=` include the payment. Insert failure logs
`gifts.record_failed` and still returns **200**. When the issued invoice stored
`messageId`, proof inserts a platform-account gift-reply first, then
`addSats` (idempotent). Optional `messageId` on
`POST /invoices`. `GET /invoices/posted` returns `{ hasPosted, messageId, postedAt }`.

CORS allows the configured origins (`CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS`, or the default
surfaces `https://21.gifts`, `https://dev.21.gifts`, `https://app.21.gifts`,
`https://dev-app.21.gifts`, and `http://localhost:3000`) and methods `GET`,
`POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`, `OPTIONS`, with headers `Authorization` and `Content-Type`.
Sessions are sent as `Authorization: Bearer` headers — no cookies,
credentials not enabled.

### `GET /healthz`

Liveness probe. No I/O; always succeeds when the process is up.

**Response** `200`:

```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "service": "21gifts-api",
  "version": "0.1.0"
}
```

`version` is `SERVICE_VERSION` (env) or `"0.1.0"` when unset.

### `GET /info`

Service identity for clients. Does not expose runtime configuration.

**Response** `200`:

```json
{
  "service": "21gifts-api",
  "version": "0.1.0",
  "description": "Backend for 21.gifts — peer-to-peer Bitcoin Lightning donations with NOSTR-native communication.",
  "repository": "https://github.com/21gifts/api"
}
```

### `GET /favicon.ico`

Brand mark for browsers that request `/favicon.ico` without HTML. No auth.
No JSON. No env vars. No Open Graph tags.

**Response** `200`: binary body, `Content-Type: image/x-icon`,
`Cache-Control: public, max-age=86400`.

**Response** `404`: empty body when the file is missing.

### `GET /favicon.svg`

SVG brand mark at the origin root. No auth. No JSON. No env vars. No Open
Graph tags.

**Response** `200`: binary body, `Content-Type: image/svg+xml`,
`Cache-Control: public, max-age=86400`.

**Response** `404`: empty body when the file is missing.

### `GET /apple-touch-icon.png`

Apple touch icon at the origin root. No auth. No JSON. No env vars. No Open
Graph tags.

**Response** `200`: binary body, `Content-Type: image/png`,
`Cache-Control: public, max-age=86400`.

**Response** `404`: empty body when the file is missing.

### `POST /auth/passkey/register/begin`

Starts a discoverable-credential registration. Empty body mints a new account
id (no row until finish). Optional JSON `{ "viewKey": "<64 lowercase hex>" }`
claims an existing provisioned account: `404` when the profile is missing,
`409` when it already has a passkey, `400` when `viewKey` is present but not a
string.

When `WEBAUTHN_RP_ID` is unset, blank, not on the allowlist (`21.gifts` /
`dev.21.gifts` / `localhost`), or no CORS origin matches that RP ID:

**Response** `500`:

```json
{ "error": "Server auth is not configured" }
```

Otherwise **Response** `200`:

```json
{
  "challengeId": "<64 hex chars>",
  "options": { "challenge": "<base64url>", "rp": { "id": "21.gifts", "name": "21.gifts" } }
}
```

`options` is `PublicKeyCredentialCreationOptionsJSON` (`residentKey` and
`userVerification` required, attestation `none`). `user.id` is the pending
account UUID encoded as UTF-8 (the provisioned account when claiming by
`viewKey`). The process still boots without
`WEBAUTHN_RP_ID` — only these routes fail closed.

### `POST /auth/passkey/register/finish`

Verifies the attestation and issues a session immediately (no poll).

Body:

```json
{ "challengeId": "<hex>", "credential": {} }
```

`credential` is the browser `RegistrationResponseJSON`. The request `Origin`
must be in the RP ID's expected origins (CORS allowlist filtered to that RP
ID).

| 400    | `{ "error": "Expected a JSON body with challengeId and credential" }` | Body parse fail                                                     |

| 400    | `{ "error": "Challenge expired" }`                                    | Past challenge TTL                                                  |
| 400    | `{ "error": "Challenge already used" }`                               | Finish already attempted; challenge is consumed before verification |
| 400    | `{ "error": "Wrong challenge type" }`                                 | Challenge is not `register`                                         |
| 400    | `{ "error": "Invalid origin" }`                                       | Missing or disallowed `Origin`                                      |
| 400    | `{ "error": "Invalid passkey" }`                                      | Attestation verify failed or duplicate credential                   |

**Response** `200`:

```json
{
  "token": "<hex>",
  "account": {
    "id": "<uuid>",
    "linkingKey": null,
    "role": "basis",
    "name": null,
    "location": null,
    "lightningAddress": null,
    "lightningAddressVerified": false,
    "forumLawsDismissed": false,
    "viewKey": "<64-hex>",
    "createdAt": 0,
    "rulesAgreedAt": null,
    "setup": "name",
    "missing": ["name", "lightning-address", "rules"],
    "hasPosted": false,
    "aboutMe": null,
    "aboutMeHasPhoto": false,
    "notificationLevel": "all"
  }
}
```

The `account` object is the same owner JSON as `GET /me` (includes `viewKey`, `setup`, `missing`, `hasPosted`, `aboutMe`, `aboutMeHasPhoto`, and `notificationLevel`).

### `POST /auth/passkey/authenticate/begin`

Starts a discoverable-credential assertion. `allowCredentials` is empty.
Same 500 as register begin when WebAuthn is unconfigured.

**Response** `200`: `{ "challengeId", "options" }` where `options` is
`PublicKeyCredentialRequestOptionsJSON`.

### `POST /auth/passkey/authenticate/finish`

Verifies the assertion against a stored credential, updates `signCount`,
issues a session. A non-increasing `signCount` is refused as
`{ "error": "Invalid passkey" }` except the authenticator `0/0` case.
Body shape matches register finish. Extra 400:
`{ "error": "Unknown credential" }` when the assertion `id` is missing or
not stored. Success body matches register finish (`linkingKey` is whatever
the account currently has).

### `GET /me`

Returns the account bound to the bearer session.

Missing or invalid bearer → **Response** `401`:

```json
{ "error": "Unauthorized" }
```

**Response** `200`:

```json
{
  "id": "<uuid>",
  "linkingKey": "<hex>",
  "role": "basis",
  "name": null,
  "location": null,
  "lightningAddress": null,
  "lightningAddressVerified": false,
  "forumLawsDismissed": false,
  "viewKey": "<64-hex>",
  "createdAt": 0,
  "rulesAgreedAt": null,
  "setup": "name",
  "missing": ["name", "lightning-address", "rules"],
  "hasPosted": false,
  "aboutMe": null,
  "aboutMeHasPhoto": false,
  "notificationLevel": "all"
}
```

About me is the profile-note text when it is a real bio, else null (auto
name-copy is not a bio, including after a display-name rename when the note
text still equals the stored profile-note `name` (Ada→Grace with text `Ada`
stays `null`)).

### `GET /me/activity`

Bearer required (same session as `GET /me`). No living-room-rules gate.

Missing or invalid bearer → **Response** `401`:

```json
{ "error": "Unauthorized" }
```

Store throw or missing BTC-USD day → **Response** `503`:

```json
{ "error": "Gift stats are unavailable" }
```

**Response** `200` (empty series when the account has no attributed gifts):

```json
{
  "donatedSats": 0,
  "receivedSats": 0,
  "donatedOverTime": [],
  "receivedOverTime": [],
  "fx": {
    "quote": "BTC-USD",
    "dayBasis": "utc",
    "source": "coinbase-exchange-daily-close",
    "quotes": [{ "code": "USD", "pair": "BTC-USD", "source": "coinbase-exchange-daily-close" }]
  }
}
```

`donatedOverTime` / `receivedOverTime` reuse the `spendOverTime` day objects from `GET /gifts/stats`, including additive CHF/EUR/PHP. USD = per-gift UTC-day Coinbase BTC-USD close. CHF/EUR/PHP = USD × that UTC day's Frankfurter ECB cross. Missing fiat is JSON `null`, never 503 (`account.activity.fiat_failed` still 200). Empty activity is 200 zeros with USD-only `fx.quotes` (no Coinbase / Frankfurter). Given = confirmed forum zaps this account paid, plus every outbound house gift when `isPlatform` is true. Received = indexed zaps on notes this account authored (including hidden and replies), plus `message.sats` remainder on **top-level** notes only (so a visible ₿21 post is never empty; gift-as-reply `sats` are not Received), plus house gifts to the account Lightning Address handle. Forum zaps are not mixed into `GET /gifts/stats`.

### `POST /me/setup/skip`

Skip a skippable wizard step. Body:

```json
{ "step": "name" }
```

or `{ "step": "lightning-address" }`. Sets the matching skip timestamp to now;
does not clear `name` / `lightningAddress`. `step: "rules"` and unknown steps
are **400**. Success → **200** owner JSON.

### `GET /members/:accountId`

Bearer required. `:accountId` must be a UUID. After auth,
`requireAction(caller, 'forum.read')` — missing rules → **409**
`{ "error": "missing_requirements", "missing": ["rules"] }`. Unknown id →
**404**. Store throw → **503** `{ "error": "Messages are unavailable" }`.
Success → live `id` / `name` / `location` / `role` / `lightningAddress` / ISO
`createdAt` plus `profileMessage` (`serializeMessage` with `accountId` /
`replyCount`, or `null`), derived `aboutMe` (profile-note text when it
is a real bio, else `null` when the profile note is missing or
soft-hidden via `deletedAt` (same as `profileMessage`); auto name-copy
is not a bio, including after a display-name rename when the note text
still equals the stored profile-note `name` (Ada→Grace with text `Ada`
stays `null`); keep `profileMessage`), `aboutMeHasPhoto` (true when the
live profile note has a stored photo; false when `profileMessage` is
`null`), uncapped live `postCount` / `replyCount` from `countByAccount`
(not the latest-200 window), and `trust` (`verifiedBy` / `proposedBy` /
`confirmedBy` / `appointedBy`, each `{ id, name }` or `null`). Default
`trust` is all-null when no stored edges exist. Never `viewKey` /
`eventId`.

### `GET /members/:accountId/posts`

Bearer required. Same 401 / 409 / 404 / 503 as `GET /members/:accountId`
(`members.posts.failed` on 503). Live-only top-level notes by the member,
newest-first, capped at 200. Body `{ "messages": [...] }` via
`serializeMessage` like signed-in `GET /messages` (`accountId`,
`replyCount`, `payable` when `eventId` and a Lightning Address are set).
Omits `parentId`. Replies by that member are not listed.

### `GET /members/:accountId/replies`

Bearer required. Same 401 / 409 / 404 / 503 as `GET /members/:accountId`
(`members.replies.failed` on 503). Live-only replies by the member,
newest-first, capped at 200. Body `{ "messages": [...] }` via
`serializeMessage` with `payable` false, `accountId`, and optional
`parentId` when set; omits `replyCount`. Top-level notes by that member
are not listed.

### `GET /members/:accountId/activity`

Same auth and 401 / 409 / 404 as `GET /members/:accountId`. Success is the
same JSON as `GET /me/activity` for **that** member. 503 `{ "error": "Gift
stats are unavailable" }` when the gift store throws or a gift day lacks
BTC-USD.

### `GET /trust-chain`

Stored trust graph. Bearer session required (any role, including basis).
Missing or invalid Bearer → **Response** `401`:

```json
{ "error": "Unauthorized" }
```

Bare `GET /trust-chain` returns
**founder seeds only** (`edges` empty) so a large chain is not dumped on
first paint. `GET /trust-chain?around=<id>` returns that chain member plus
one hop of **stored** public edges with at most one incoming kind per
subject: the oldest eligible sibling (`createdAt` then `id`). Eligible:
`verify`, `moderator_appoint`, and `moderator_propose` only when the live
subject is a `moderator`; `moderator_confirm` never. Later appoint,
confirm, or propose do not replace an earlier eligible contact. A pending
propose (subject still `verified`) stays private and is not a hop neighbor.
Neighborhood must consider all stored edges for each subject, not only
edges that touch `around`. Nodes are `founder` / `moderator` / `verified`
(never `basis`).
No synthetic or inferred edges. Lightning addresses, view keys, and
linking keys are omitted. Omitting `around` (or empty) is founder seeds.
A supplied `around` that is not a uuid (including Postgres `22P02`),
unknown, or `basis` → **404** `{ "error": "Not found" }`. Unauthenticated
`around` is 401, not 404.

Store throw → **Response** `503`:

```json
{ "error": "Trust chain is unavailable" }
```

Logged as `trust.chain.failed`.

**Response** `200` bare GET (or empty `around`; empty arrays when none):

```json
{
  "nodes": [{ "id": "<uuid>", "name": "Cyrill", "role": "founder" }],
  "edges": []
}
```

**Response** `200` `?around=<id>` (one hop of stored public edges; empty `edges` when the member has none):

```json
{
  "nodes": [
    { "id": "<uuid>", "name": "Cyrill", "role": "founder" },
    { "id": "<uuid>", "name": "Ada", "role": "verified" }
  ],
  "edges": [{ "from": "<actor-uuid>", "to": "<subject-uuid>", "kind": "verify" }]
}
```

### `GET /trust/proposals`

Staff pending-moderator queue. Bearer **session** required (founder or
moderator). This is **not** a `DEBUG_TOKEN` route. No `forum.read` /
rules gate — a founder/moderator without rules agreement is still **200**.

Lists pending `moderator_propose` edges whose live subject is still
`verified` and has no `moderator_confirm` or `moderator_appoint`. Missing
subjects are omitted. Oldest `createdAt` first, then propose-edge `id`
(FIFO). JSON `{ "proposals": [ … ] }` including an empty list. Each item
is `{ subject: { id, name, role: "verified" }, proposedBy: { id, name },
createdAt }` with ISO-8601 `createdAt`. A missing actor is
`{ id, name: null }`. `GET /trust-chain` still omits a pending
`moderator_propose`. Once the subject is a `moderator`, that propose is
eligible as the public incoming edge only when it is the oldest eligible
sibling (`createdAt` then `id`).

Missing/invalid/expired bearer → **Response** `401`:

```json
{ "error": "Unauthorized" }
```

Live role is not founder and not moderator → **Response** `403`:

```json
{ "error": "Forbidden" }
```

Store or project throw → **Response** `503`:

```json
{ "error": "Trust chain is unavailable" }
```

Success (including an empty list) → **Response** `200`:

```json
{
  "proposals": [
    {
      "subject": { "id": "<uuid>", "name": "Ada", "role": "verified" },
      "proposedBy": { "id": "<uuid>", "name": "Mod" },
      "createdAt": "2026-09-16T00:00:00.000Z"
    }
  ]
}
```

On success the process logs `trust.proposals.listed` with `{ count }`
only. On throw it logs `trust.proposals.failed`.

### `POST /trust/verify`

Bearer session. Body `{ "accountId": "<uuid>" }`. Caller must be `founder`
or `moderator`. Inserts a `verify` edge from the caller to the subject,
then sets `account.role` to `verified`. `verified` is a real-life
confirmation (forum badge), not Lightning-Address proof.

Missing/invalid bearer → **401** `{ "error": "Unauthorized" }`.
Caller not staff → **403** `{ "error": "Forbidden" }`.
Body is not JSON with an `accountId` string → **400**
`{ "error": "Expected a JSON body with an \"accountId\" string" }`.
`accountId` is not a UUID or the subject is missing → **404**
`{ "error": "Not found" }`.
Subject is the caller, a verify edge belongs to someone else, or the
subject is ineligible (`role` is not `basis`, except the caller-owned
retry below) → **409** `{ "error": "Conflict" }`.
Unexpected store throw → **503** `{ "error": "Trust chain is unavailable" }`
logged as `trust.write.failed`.

Idempotent **200** when the existing verify edge's actor is the caller and
the subject is already `verified` (no second insert). If that caller-owned
edge exists and the subject is still `basis`, completes the role write and
returns **200**.

Otherwise insert the edge then update role, log `trust.verified`
`{ subjectId, actorId }`.

**Response** `200`:

```json
{ "id": "<uuid>", "name": "Ada", "role": "verified" }
```

### `POST /trust/propose-moderator`

Bearer session. Body `{ "accountId": "<uuid>" }`. Staff only. Subject role
must be `verified`, not self, and must not already have
`moderator_propose` / `moderator_confirm` / `moderator_appoint` or be
`moderator`/`founder`. Inserts `moderator_propose` without changing role.
Logs `trust.moderator_proposed`. Same 401/403/400/404/409/503 shapes as
`POST /trust/verify`. **200** `{ id, name, role }` (role unchanged).

### `POST /trust/confirm-moderator`

Bearer session. Body `{ "accountId": "<uuid>" }`. Staff only. A pending
`moderator_propose` must exist; the caller id must not equal the proposer's
actor id (independent second staff member). Subject must still be
`verified`. Inserts `moderator_confirm` then sets role to `moderator`, logs
`trust.moderator_confirmed`. If the caller already stored `moderator_confirm`
and the subject is still `verified`, completes the role write and returns
**200**; already-moderator with that caller-owned edge is idempotent **200**.
Same 401/403/400/404/409/503 JSON shapes (409 when a confirm edge belongs
to someone else). **200** `{ id, name, role }` with `role: "moderator"`.
After a 200 that leaves the subject as `moderator` (new grant and
idempotent already-moderator same-actor 200), the api notifies the
subject only (`moderator_appointed`, Web Push url `/welcome`). Notify
failure does not fail the POST.

### `POST /trust/appoint-moderator`

Bearer session. Body `{ "accountId": "<uuid>" }`. Caller must be `founder`
(moderators → **403**). Subject must not be self, not `founder`, and not
already `moderator`; subject may be `basis` or `verified`. Inserts
`moderator_appoint` then sets role to `moderator`, logs
`trust.moderator_appointed`. If the caller already stored `moderator_appoint`
and the subject is not yet `moderator`, completes the role write and returns
**200**; already-moderator with that caller-owned edge is idempotent **200**.
Same 401/403/400/404/409/503 shapes as `POST /trust/verify` (403
when the caller is not a founder). **200** `{ id, name, role }` with
`role: "moderator"`. After a 200 that leaves the subject as
`moderator` (new grant and idempotent already-moderator same-actor
200), the api notifies the subject only (`moderator_appointed`, Web
Push url `/welcome`). Notify failure does not fail the POST.

### `GET /view/:viewKey`

Public capability URL for a read-only profile card. No auth. Not a session:
the key cannot write, cannot mint a session, and is not accepted as
`Authorization: Bearer`.

Param not matching `/^[0-9a-f]{64}$/` or an unknown key → **Response** `404`:

```json
{ "error": "Not found" }
```

**Response** `200` (eight fields only; omits `id`, `linkingKey`, `role`, `viewKey`):

```json
{
  "name": null,
  "location": null,
  "lightningAddress": null,
  "lightningAddressVerified": false,
  "createdAt": 0,
  "hasPasskey": false,
  "aboutMe": null,
  "aboutMeHasPhoto": false
}
```

`hasPasskey` is `true` when the account has at least one passkey credential,
otherwise `false`. Clients use it to show an activation banner only while the
profile is still unclaimed. `aboutMe` is the profile-note text when it is a
real bio, else `null` (missing or soft-hidden (`deletedAt` set); auto
name-copy is not a bio, including after a display-name rename when the note
text still equals the stored profile-note `name` (Ada→Grace with text `Ada`
stays `null`)). `aboutMeHasPhoto` is true when the live profile note has a
stored photo; bytes are `GET /view/:viewKey/about/photo`. Store throw on the
profile-note read → **503** `{ "error": "Messages are unavailable" }`
(`view.get.failed`).

### `GET /view/:viewKey/activity`

Public. Same 404 as `GET /view/:viewKey` for a bad or unknown key. Success is
the same JSON as `GET /me/activity` for the account behind the key. 503
`{ "error": "Gift stats are unavailable" }` when the gift store throws or a
gift day lacks BTC-USD.

### `POST /me/name`

Set or replace the account display name. Body:

```json
{ "name": "Ada" }
```

Missing/invalid bearer → **Response** `401` `{ "error": "Unauthorized" }`.

Body is not JSON with a `name` string → **Response** `400`:

```json
{ "error": "Expected a JSON body with a \"name\" string" }
```

Name is empty after trim, longer than 80 characters, or contains a C0
control / DEL character (`charCode < 32` or `=== 127`) → **Response** `400`:

```json
{ "error": "Name must be 1–80 characters" }
```

Success → **Response** `200` with the updated account (same shape as
`GET /me`). The stored value is trimmed. Names are not unique. When a
non-blank Lightning Address is already linked, the first persisted
non-empty name also creates exactly one top-level profile forum note and
claims `profileMessageId` via `claimProfileMessageId` (set only while the pointer still matches the missing/hidden read; not on owner JSON). Without a Lightning
Address the name is stored and no profile note is inserted (linking the
address later creates it). Rename does not create a second note and does
not change the note text.

### `POST /me/location`

Set, change, or clear the account free-text location. Body:

```json
{ "location": "Berlin" }
```

Missing/invalid bearer → **Response** `401` `{ "error": "Unauthorized" }`.

Body is not JSON with a `location` string → **Response** `400`:

```json
{ "error": "Expected a JSON body with a \"location\" string" }
```

Location is longer than 80 characters after trim, or contains a C0
control / DEL character (`charCode < 32` or `=== 127`) → **Response** `400`:

```json
{ "error": "Location must be at most 80 characters" }
```

Success → **Response** `200` with the updated account (same shape as
`GET /me`). Empty or whitespace-only input stores `null` (clears). The
stored non-empty value is trimmed. Location is not unique, not a setup
step, and not a posting requirement. It is public on member and view
cards. Does not create or update a profile forum note.

### `PUT /me/about`

Set or clear About me on the profile forum note. Body:

```json
{ "text": "I build on Bitcoin", "photo": { "contentType": "image/jpeg", "data": "<base64>" } }
```

`text` is required. `photo` is optional: omitted leaves a stored photo;
JSON `null` clears it; `{ contentType, data }` is decoded with
`decodeForumPhoto` (same JPEG/PNG/WebP under 1 MiB as `POST /messages`).

Missing/invalid bearer → **Response** `401` `{ "error": "Unauthorized" }`.

Body is not JSON with a `text` string → **Response** `400`:

```json
{ "error": "Expected a JSON body with a \"text\" string" }
```

`text` is a string but `photo` is present and neither `null` nor
`{ contentType, data }`, or decode fails → **Response** `400`:

```json
{ "error": "Photo must be a JPEG, PNG, or WebP under 1 MiB" }
```

Text longer than 500 characters after trim (or containing a disallowed
control character) → **Response** `400`:

```json
{ "error": "About me must be at most 500 characters" }
```

Display name is blank → **Response** `409`:

```json
{ "error": "missing_requirements", "missing": ["name"] }
```

Lightning Address is not required. Empty `text` clears the bio
(`aboutMe` becomes `null`; a live note row is kept with empty text).
When no live profile note exists (missing or soft-hidden), empty text
with `photo` omitted or `null` does not create a note and does not
notify. Empty text **with** a decoded photo creates a photo-only live
note. A non-empty write with no live note (missing or soft-hidden)
creates a new live note even without a Lightning Address and claims
`profileMessageId` via `claimProfileMessageId` only while the pointer
still matches the missing/hidden read (not on owner JSON); a lost claim
deletes the insert and adopts a live winner. A won inline create calls
`notifyForumPost` after the writes (best-effort; enqueue failure still
200). Updating an already-live note does not notify. The hidden row
stays hidden. A published sats=0 note is unsigned (`resetSignedEvent`)
so kind:1 can be rewritten.
Store throw → **503** `{ "error": "Messages are unavailable" }`
(`account.about.failed`).

Success → **Response** `200` with the account (same shape as `GET /me`).
About me is the profile-note text when it is a real bio, else null (auto
name-copy is not a bio, including after a display-name rename when the
note text still equals the stored profile-note `name` (Ada→Grace with
text `Ada` stays `null`)). `aboutMeHasPhoto` is true when the live note
has a stored photo.

### `GET /me/about/photo`

Bearer. Raw profile-note photo bytes (`forumPhotoResponse`: jpeg/png/webp
`Content-Type`, one-day public cache, CORS `*`, inline filename).

Missing/invalid bearer → **Response** `401` `{ "error": "Unauthorized" }`.

No live profile note or no photo → **Response** `404`
`{ "error": "Photo not found" }`.

Store throw → **Response** `503` `{ "error": "Messages are unavailable" }`
(`account.about.photo.failed`).

### `GET /view/:viewKey/about/photo`

Public. Same bytes as `GET /me/about/photo` for the account behind the
view key. Invalid or unknown key → **404** `{ "error": "Not found" }`.
No live note or no photo → **404** `{ "error": "Photo not found" }`.
Store throw → **503** `{ "error": "Messages are unavailable" }`
(`view.photo.failed`).

### `POST /me/forum-laws-dismissed`

Mark the welcome-forum living-room laws hint as dismissed. No body.

Missing/invalid bearer → **Response** `401` `{ "error": "Unauthorized" }`.

Success → **Response** `200` with the updated account (same shape as
`GET /me`), with `forumLawsDismissed: true`. Already-dismissed accounts return
the same shape without a second write (idempotent). There is no un-dismiss.

### `POST /me/notification-level`

Set the owner fan-out filter. Bearer session required (same as
`POST /me/forum-laws-dismissed`). Body:

```json
{ "level": "active" }
```

`level` must be `all`, `active`, or `mentions`.

Missing/invalid bearer → **Response** `401` `{ "error": "Unauthorized" }`.

Body is missing, not JSON, or `level` is not one of those three strings
→ **Response** `400`:

```json
{ "error": "Expected a JSON body with a level of all, active, or mentions" }
```

Success → **Response** `200` with the updated account (same owner JSON as
`GET /me`), including `notificationLevel`. The same level again is still
**200** (idempotent). Logs `account.notification_level.set` with
`accountId` and `level`.

### `POST /me/rules-agreement`

Record that the signed-in account agreed to the living-room rules. No body
is required; any JSON body is ignored.

Missing/invalid bearer → **Response** `401`:

```json
{ "error": "Unauthorized" }
```

Success → **Response** `200` with the account (same shape as `GET /me`). The
first successful POST sets `rulesAgreedAt` to the server clock (epoch ms).
Later POSTs return the original timestamp unchanged (idempotent; no 409).
New accounts start with `rulesAgreedAt: null`. Name and Lightning Address
link/unlink do not clear the timestamp.

### `POST /me/lightning-address`

Link or replace the receiver Lightning Address. After the LUD-16 shape check,
the api live-resolves the well-known LNURL-pay metadata and requires zap
support (`allowsNostr === true` and a non-empty `nostrPubkey`). It then runs a
NIP-57 mint probe (`probeNip57Mint` with the account's custodial key): a
throwaway kind:9734 is signed, an invoice is requested (never paid), and the
BOLT11 must be a NIP-57 `description_hash` invoice. Placeholder, unreachable,
or non-zap addresses are rejected and not stored. Body:

```json
{ "address": "name@domain.tld" }
```

Missing/invalid bearer → **Response** `401` `{ "error": "Unauthorized" }`.

Body is not JSON with an `address` string → **Response** `400`:

```json
{ "error": "Expected a JSON body with an \"address\" string" }
```

Address fails LUD-16 shape check, or trimmed length `> 255` → **Response**
`400`:

```json
{ "error": "Not a valid Lightning Address (expected name@domain)" }
```

Well-known resolve fails, metadata lacks zap support, or the mint probe is
`unreachable` → **Response** `400` (account unchanged; logs
`account.lightning_address.resolve_failed`):

```json
{ "error": "Lightning Address could not be resolved" }
```

Mint probe returns `not_zap` (wallet advertised zap support but the minted
invoice is not NIP-57) → **Response** `400` (account unchanged; logs
`account.lightning_address.not_zap`):

```json
{ "error": "This Wallet of Satoshi address cannot receive these Bitcoin payments" }
```

Missing `NOSTR_NSEC_KEK` / `nostrKek`, key ensure failure, or a missing
account pubkey after ensure → **Response** `503` (account unchanged):

```json
{ "error": "Lightning Address could not be resolved" }
```

Another account already owns the address (including a unique-index race)
→ **Response** `409`:

```json
{ "error": "Lightning Address is already in use" }
```

Success → **Response** `200` with the updated account (same shape as
`GET /me`). `lightningAddressVerified` is always reset to `false`, and any
pending verification for the account is cleared. After the address is
stored, `ensureProfileMessage` runs so a non-blank display name that was
set earlier gets its profile forum note. There is no proof-of-control in
this step — use `POST /me/lightning-address/verification` for that.

### `DELETE /me/lightning-address`

Unlink the receiver Lightning Address. Also clears any pending verification
for the account.

Missing/invalid bearer → **Response** `401` `{ "error": "Unauthorized" }`.

Success → **Response** `200` with the updated account:

- `lightningAddress`: `null`
- `lightningAddressVerified`: `false`

### `POST /me/lightning-address/verification`

Start proof-of-control for the linked Lightning Address. No request body.

The api resolves the address via LUD-16 / LNURL-pay, pays **1 sat** (or the
provider's `minSendable` if higher, capped at 10 sat) with a one-time nonce in
the LUD-12 comment (`21gifts <32-hex-nonce>`), and stores a pending
verification (TTL 15 minutes). The **nonce is never returned** — the user
reads it from their wallet payment history and posts it to confirm.

Missing/invalid bearer → **Response** `401`:

```json
{ "error": "Unauthorized" }
```

No linked address → **Response** `409`:

```json
{ "error": "No Lightning Address linked" }
```

Address already verified → **Response** `409`:

```json
{ "error": "Lightning Address already verified" }
```

No invoice payer configured (default until a real payer is wired) →
**Response** `503`:

```json
{ "error": "Verification payments are not configured" }
```

LNURL-pay resolve/invoice failure, or payment failure → **Response** `502`:

```json
{ "error": "Lightning Address did not accept the verification payment" }
```

Success → **Response** `200`:

```json
{ "status": "sent", "expiresInSeconds": 900, "sats": 1 }
```

| Field              | Meaning                                                                               |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `status`           | Always `"sent"` on success                                                            |
| `expiresInSeconds` | Seconds until the pending record expires                                              |
| `sats`             | Amount paid, in sats (`payMsat / 1000`; fractional if minSendable is not a whole sat) |

Linking or unlinking the address clears any pending verification.

### `POST /me/lightning-address/verification/confirm`

Confirm proof-of-control with the nonce from the wallet history. Body:

```json
{ "nonce": "<32 hex chars>" }
```

Missing/invalid bearer → **Response** `401`:

```json
{ "error": "Unauthorized" }
```

Body is not JSON with a `nonce` string → **Response** `400`:

```json
{ "error": "Expected a JSON body with a \"nonce\" string" }
```

Empty nonce after trim, or nonce does not match → **Response** `400`:

```json
{ "error": "Incorrect verification code" }
```

No pending verification (or address no longer matches the record) →
**Response** `409`:

```json
{ "error": "No verification in progress" }
```

Pending verification past the TTL → **Response** `409`:

```json
{ "error": "Verification expired" }
```

Success → **Response** `200` with the updated account (same shape as
`GET /me`), with `lightningAddressVerified: true`. The pending record is
deleted.

### `GET /lightning-address`

Public LUD-16 metadata resolve for a future guest Donate flow. The api is
**not** in the payment path: this route returns cached well-known LNURL-pay
metadata only. It never fetches a BOLT11 invoice (`pr`) and never pays.

Query parameter:

| Param     | Required | Meaning                               |
| --------- | -------- | ------------------------------------- |
| `address` | yes      | Lightning Address (`name@domain.tld`) |

The value is normalised with the same LUD-16 shape check as
`POST /me/lightning-address` (trim; length ≤ 255; `local@domain.tld`).

Missing, empty, not LUD-16, or length `> 255` → **Response** `400`:

```json
{ "error": "Not a valid Lightning Address (expected name@domain)" }
```

Well-known fetch / JSON / schema failure, non-HTTPS callback, or network
error → **Response** `502`:

```json
{ "error": "Lightning Address could not be resolved" }
```

Success → **Response** `200`:

```json
{
  "address": "name@domain.tld",
  "callback": "https://…",
  "minSendable": 1000,
  "maxSendable": 100000000000,
  "commentAllowed": 255
}
```

| Field            | Type   | Meaning                                             |
| ---------------- | ------ | --------------------------------------------------- |
| `address`        | string | Normalised query value                              |
| `callback`       | string | LNURL-pay callback URL (`https:` only)              |
| `minSendable`    | number | Minimum sendable amount, millisatoshis              |
| `maxSendable`    | number | Maximum sendable amount, millisatoshis              |
| `commentAllowed` | number | Optional; omitted when the provider did not send it |

**Cache**: successful resolves are stored in process memory for **5 minutes**
(`LN_ADDRESS_CACHE_TTL_MS`). A cache hit does not call the provider. Process
restart clears the cache. There is no durable (Postgres) cache yet. No auth.
No new environment variables for this route; the process still boots with
zero extra config when `DATABASE_URL` and `DEBUG_TOKEN` are unset.

### `GET /debug/accounts`

Operator listing of every stored account. Authenticated with
`Authorization: Bearer` matching `DEBUG_TOKEN`. This is not an end-user
session. Session tokens and verification nonces are never returned.

`DEBUG_TOKEN` unset or blank → **Response** `503`:

```json
{ "error": "Debug is not configured" }
```

Missing or non-matching bearer → **Response** `401`:

```json
{ "error": "Unauthorized" }
```

Success → **Response** `200`:

```json
{
  "accounts": [
    {
      "id": "<uuid>",
      "linkingKey": "<hex>",
      "role": "basis",
      "name": null,
      "location": null,
      "lightningAddress": null,
      "lightningAddressVerified": false,
      "forumLawsDismissed": false,
      "createdAt": 0,
      "rulesAgreedAt": null,
      "isPlatform": false
    }
  ]
}
```

The listing uses `serializeDebugAccount` (the ten public fields plus
`isPlatform`) and never includes `viewKey`. Member `GET /me` does not
include `isPlatform`.

Accounts are ordered by `createdAt` ascending, then `id`. An empty store
returns `"accounts": []`.

Environment:

| Variable       | Meaning                                                                 |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `DATABASE_URL` | When set, auth state is stored in Postgres; when unset, in-memory only. |
| `DEBUG_TOKEN`  | Operator bearer for this route. Unset → 503; process still boots.       |

### `POST /debug/accounts`

Operator provision of accounts by display name and Lightning Address, with no
passkey and `rulesAgreedAt` null. Same `DEBUG_TOKEN` bearer as GET. **All**
new addresses are NIP-57 mint-probed (`probeNip57Mint` with an ephemeral key)
first; only then is any row persisted. Set `NIP57_PROBE=0` to skip that probe
(e2e only; Playwright pins it). Unset in production so every new address is
still probed. One failing new-address probe is
**400** and no new address in that request is saved. Name-only updates
(address already in the store) do **not** probe and run after every probe
has passed.

**Request** JSON `{ "accounts": [ { "name": string, "lightningAddress": string } ] }`
(1–100 rows; name 1–80 after trim; address has exactly one `@` with both sides
non-empty). Invalid body, C0/DEL in a name, or an address that is not LUD-16
→ **Response** `400` `{ "error": "Expected a JSON body with an \"accounts\" array" }`
(no row is written). Mint probe `not_zap` → **Response** `400`
`{ "error": "This Wallet of Satoshi address cannot receive these Bitcoin payments" }`
(no new address in that request is saved). Mint probe `unreachable` → **Response** `400`
`{ "error": "Lightning Address could not be resolved" }` (no new address in
that request is saved). Create that does
not persist the address, a name-only update that matches no row, or a
name-only update that returns a row whose `name` is not the requested name
→ **Response** `500` `{ "error": "Could not save the account" }`.

Success → **Response** `200`:

```json
{
  "accounts": [
    {
      "name": "Ada",
      "lightningAddress": "guest@walletofsatoshi.com",
      "viewKey": "<64 lowercase hex>",
      "created": true
    }
  ]
}
```

Existing address (`lower(trim)`): updates **only** `name` (atomic name-only
write; `viewKey`, `role`, `rulesAgreedAt`, and other columns stay unchanged),
`created` is `false`. New address: fresh `viewKey`, `created` is `true`. GET
still omits `viewKey`.

### `PATCH /debug/accounts/:id`

Operator assignment of the account's forum display role, unlinking the
Lightning Address, and/or the official platform flag (`isPlatform`).
Authenticated with `Authorization: Bearer` matching `DEBUG_TOKEN` (same
gate as `GET /debug/accounts`). Body is one or more of `role`,
`lightningAddress: null`, and `platform`:

```json
{ "role": "basis", "lightningAddress": null, "platform": true }
```

`role` must be one of `basis`, `verified`, `moderator`, or `founder`.
`lightningAddress` may only be JSON `null` (unlink). `platform` is a
boolean; `true` clears any other platform flag (at most one `isPlatform`
account) and, when a conversation store is wired, points every
`member_platform` thread at this account except a thread whose member is
already this account. Setting a new address is not supported here
(`POST /me/lightning-address` remains the live resolve path). Unlink
resets `lightningAddressVerified` to `false` and drops any in-flight
verification. `GET /me` then returns `setup: "lightning-address"` when a
name is already stored, so any client that follows `setup` (or a missing
`lightningAddress`) shows the address form. `verified` as a **role** is a
human-identity badge (a founder or moderator physically met the person); it
is not `lightningAddressVerified`. New passkey accounts stay `basis` until
staff confirm them via `POST /trust/verify` or an operator overrides `role`
here. This route does **not** write trust edges;
use `POST /debug/trust-edges` to backfill stored grants without changing
`role`.

`DEBUG_TOKEN` unset or blank → **Response** `503`:

```json
{ "error": "Debug is not configured" }
```

Missing or non-matching bearer → **Response** `401`:

```json
{ "error": "Unauthorized" }
```

Body is not JSON with a known `role`, `lightningAddress: null`, and/or
`platform` boolean → **Response** `400`:

```json
{
  "error": "Expected a JSON body with a \"role\" string, lightningAddress null, and/or platform boolean"
}
```

Unknown account id → **Response** `404`:

```json
{ "error": "Not found" }
```

Success → **Response** `200` with the updated account JSON (same
`serializeDebugAccount` shape as `GET /debug/accounts`, including
`isPlatform`; no `viewKey`). Role changes log `debug.accounts.role_set`
with the account id and new role. Unlink logs
`debug.accounts.lightning_address.cleared` with the account id (never the
token or the previous address). Platform changes log
`debug.accounts.platform_set` with the account id and the new flag.

### `POST /debug/accounts/:id/session`

Operator mint of a member bearer for the given account id. Authenticated
with `Authorization: Bearer` matching `DEBUG_TOKEN`. Response `{ "token": "<hex>" }`.
Unknown account id → **404** `{ "error": "Not found" }`. Same 503/401 gate as
the other debug account routes. Not a member login path; for e2e and
operator debugging.

### `POST /debug/trust-edges`

Operator backfill of a stored trust edge. Authenticated with
`Authorization: Bearer` matching `DEBUG_TOKEN` (same 503/401 gate as the
other debug routes). Does **not** change `account.role`.

**Request**:

```json
{
  "subjectId": "<uuid>",
  "actorId": "<uuid>",
  "kind": "verify"
}
```

`kind` is one of `verify`, `moderator_propose`, `moderator_confirm`,
`moderator_appoint`.

Bad body → **400** `{ "error": "Expected a JSON body with \"subjectId\", \"actorId\", and \"kind\" strings" }`.
Missing subject or actor (or a non-UUID id) → **404** `{ "error": "Not found" }`.
Duplicate `(subjectId, kind)` or `subjectId === actorId` → **409**
`{ "error": "Conflict" }`.
Unexpected store throw → **503** `{ "error": "Trust chain is unavailable" }`
logged as `debug.trust_edges.failed`.
Success logs `debug.trust_edges.inserted` `{ subjectId, actorId, kind }`.

**Response** `200`:

```json
{
  "id": "<uuid>",
  "subjectId": "<uuid>",
  "actorId": "<uuid>",
  "kind": "verify",
  "createdAt": "2026-09-12T00:00:00.000Z"
}
```

`createdAt` is ISO-8601.

### `DELETE /debug/trust-edges`

Operator delete of a stored trust edge. Authenticated with
`Authorization: Bearer` matching `DEBUG_TOKEN` (same 503/401 gate as the
other debug routes). Does **not** change `account.role`. Unique
`(subjectId, kind)` means one row is enough to identify.

**Request**:

```json
{
  "subjectId": "<uuid>",
  "kind": "moderator_confirm"
}
```

`kind` is one of `verify`, `moderator_propose`, `moderator_confirm`,
`moderator_appoint`.

Bad body → **400** `{ "error": "Expected a JSON body with \"subjectId\" and \"kind\" strings" }`.
Non-UUID `subjectId` or no matching row → **404** `{ "error": "Not found" }`.
Unexpected store throw → **503** `{ "error": "Trust chain is unavailable" }`
logged as `debug.trust_edges.delete_failed`.
Success logs `debug.trust_edges.deleted` `{ subjectId, kind }`.

**Response** `200` is the deleted edge, same JSON as `POST /debug/trust-edges`.

### `GET /debug/contacts`

Operator listing of private in-app contact messages. Authenticated with
`Authorization: Bearer` matching `DEBUG_TOKEN`. This is not an end-user
session. Contacts are never listed on a member-facing route.

`DEBUG_TOKEN` unset or blank → **Response** `503`:

```json
{ "error": "Debug is not configured" }
```

Missing or non-matching bearer → **Response** `401`:

```json
{ "error": "Unauthorized" }
```

Store failure → **Response** `503`:

```json
{ "error": "Contact is unavailable" }
```

Success → **Response** `200`:

```json
{
  "contacts": [
    {
      "id": "<uuid>",
      "accountId": "<uuid>",
      "name": "Ada",
      "text": "Hello",
      "createdAt": "2026-08-29T12:00:00.000Z"
    }
  ]
}
```

Contacts are newest-first (`createdAt` descending, then `id`), capped at
**200**. An empty mailbox returns `"contacts": []`. When `DATABASE_URL` is
unset the default in-memory store starts empty; when set, rows come from
Postgres `contact`.

Environment:

| Variable       | Meaning                                                                |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `DATABASE_URL` | When set, contacts are stored in Postgres; when unset, in-memory only. |
| `DEBUG_TOKEN`  | Operator bearer for this route. Unset → 503; process still boots.      |

### `GET /debug/invoices`

Operator listing of all `message_invoice` attempts (forum
`POST /messages/:id/invoice` and conversation `POST /conversations/:id/invoice`).
Authenticated with `Authorization: Bearer` matching `DEBUG_TOKEN`. This is not
an end-user session.

`DEBUG_TOKEN` unset or blank → **Response** `503`:

```json
{ "error": "Debug is not configured" }
```

Missing or non-matching bearer → **Response** `401`:

```json
{ "error": "Unauthorized" }
```

Store failure → **Response** `503`:

```json
{ "error": "Messages are unavailable" }
```

Success → **Response** `200`:

```json
{
  "invoices": [
    {
      "id": "<uuid>",
      "createdAt": "2026-08-30T12:00:00.000Z",
      "messageId": "<uuid>",
      "payerAccountId": "<uuid>",
      "authorAccountId": "<uuid>",
      "amountSats": 21,
      "lightningAddress": "user@walletofsatoshi.com",
      "zapRequest": { "kind": 9734 },
      "result": "ok",
      "httpStatus": 200,
      "pr": "lnbc21n1...",
      "paymentHash": "<64-hex>",
      "description": null,
      "descriptionHash": "<64-hex>",
      "isNip57Invoice": true,
      "lnurlResponse": { "pr": "lnbc21n1...", "status": "OK" }
    }
  ]
}
```

`lnurlResponse` is the raw LNURL callback JSON object, or `null` when none
was stored. Rows are newest-first, capped at **200**. Never includes nsec.
`serializeInvoice` omits `conversationId` and `conversationMessageId` even
when the row is a conversation invoice.
`result` is one of `ok`, `noZap`, `not_zap`, `unreachable`, `no_event`,
`no_author`, `no_key`,
`sign_failed`, `rate_limited`, `bad_body`, `not_found`. `isNip57Invoice` is
true only when `descriptionHash` equals SHA-256 of the zap-request JSON string
sent as LNURL `nostr=`. Failure rows have `pr` null and `isNip57Invoice`
false, except `not_zap` which stores the rejected BOLT11 (`pr` set,
`isNip57Invoice` false). When `DATABASE_URL` is unset the in-memory store
starts empty.

Environment:

| Variable       | Meaning                                                           |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `DATABASE_URL` | When set, attempts are stored in Postgres `message_invoice`.      |
| `DEBUG_TOKEN`  | Operator bearer for this route. Unset → 503; process still boots. |

### `GET /debug/zap-ingests`

Operator listing of kind:9735 ingest decisions (`indexed` or `rejected`).
Authenticated with `Authorization: Bearer` matching `DEBUG_TOKEN`. This is not
an end-user session.

`DEBUG_TOKEN` unset or blank → **Response** `503`:

```json
{ "error": "Debug is not configured" }
```

Missing or non-matching bearer → **Response** `401`:

```json
{ "error": "Unauthorized" }
```

Store failure → **Response** `503`:

```json
{ "error": "Messages are unavailable" }
```

Success → **Response** `200`:

```json
{
  "ingests": [
    {
      "id": "<uuid>",
      "createdAt": "2026-08-30T12:00:00.000Z",
      "receiptId": "<64-hex>",
      "noteEventId": "<64-hex>",
      "messageId": "<uuid>",

      "receiptPubkey": "<64-hex>",
      "receipt": { "id": "<64-hex>", "kind": 9735 }
    }
  ]
}
```

Rows are newest-first, capped at **200**. Never includes nsec. When
`DATABASE_URL` is unset the in-memory store starts empty.

Environment:

| Variable       | Meaning                                                           |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `DATABASE_URL` | When set, ingest rows are stored in Postgres `nostr_zap_ingest`.  |
| `DEBUG_TOKEN`  | Operator bearer for this route. Unset → 503; process still boots. |

### `GET /debug/messages`

Operator listing of every persisted forum row (top-level **and** replies,
live **and** soft-hidden). Authenticated with `Authorization: Bearer`
matching `DEBUG_TOKEN`. Public hide does not apply. Cap 200, newest-first.
JSON `{ "messages": [ … ] }` via `serializeDebugMessage`. Never includes
`nostrEvent`, `contentFp`, nsec, or photo/video bytes.

`DEBUG_TOKEN` unset or blank → **Response** `503`:

```json
{ "error": "Debug is not configured" }
```

Missing or non-matching bearer → **Response** `401`:

```json
{ "error": "Unauthorized" }
```

Store throw → **Response** `503`:

```json
{ "error": "Messages are unavailable" }
```

### `GET /debug/messages/:id`

Operator single-note fetch. Soft-hidden rows are **200** with `deletedAt` /
`deletedBy` / `text`. Unknown or non-UUID id → **Response** `404`:

```json
{ "error": "Not found" }
```

Same debug token gate as `GET /debug/messages`. Body is the debug object
(not wrapped). Never includes `nostrEvent`, `contentFp`, nsec, or photo/video
bytes.

Store throw → **Response** `503`:

```json
{ "error": "Messages are unavailable" }
```

### `GET /debug/messages/:id/photo`

Operator JPEG/PNG/WebP bytes, **including** soft-hidden notes. Same
`Content-Type` / `Content-Disposition` / CORS as public
`GET /messages/:id/photo`. Missing row, no photo, or non-UUID id →
**Response** `404`:

```json
{ "error": "Photo not found" }
```

Same debug token gate as `GET /debug/messages`.

Store throw → **Response** `503`:

```json
{ "error": "Messages are unavailable" }
```

### `PUT /debug/messages/:id/video`

Operator restore of missing forum-video bytes for an **existing**
`hasVideo` row. Authenticated with `Authorization: Bearer` matching
`DEBUG_TOKEN`. This is not an end-user session. The raw body is
`decodeForumVideo`'d and written under `MEDIA_DIR`; the handler does
not insert a message row or change columns.

`DEBUG_TOKEN` unset or blank → **Response** `503`:

```json
{ "error": "Debug is not configured" }
```

Missing or non-matching bearer → **Response** `401` (checked before the
body is read):

```json
{ "error": "Unauthorized" }
```

Non-UUID or unknown id → **Response** `404`:

```json
{ "error": "Not found" }
```

Row has no video, or stored MIME missing → **Response** `409`:

```json
{ "error": "Message has no video" }
```

Decoded type extension does not match the stored MIME → **Response**
`409`:

```json
{ "error": "Video type does not match" }
```

Empty, oversize, or unrecognized bytes → **Response** `400`:

```json
{ "error": "Expected a video body" }
```

Store or disk write throws → **Response** `503`:

```json
{ "error": "Messages are unavailable" }
```

Success → **Response** `204` with an empty body. Public
`GET /messages/:id/video.mp4` (or `.mov` / `.webm` matching the stored
type) can then serve the file.

Environment:

| Variable      | Meaning                                                           |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `DEBUG_TOKEN` | Operator bearer for this route. Unset → 503; process still boots. |
| `MEDIA_DIR`   | Directory the bytes are written to. Required at boot.             |

### `POST /debug/messages/:id/restore`

Operator unhide of a soft-hidden forum note. Authenticated with
`Authorization: Bearer` matching `DEBUG_TOKEN`. This is not an end-user
session and not a founder/moderator UNHIDE. Calls `markUndeleted`: the
inverse of `markDeleted`'s cascade (clears `deletedAt` / `deletedBy` on
the hidden target and stamp-matched **direct** children; already-live
target is a no-op for children). Does not recreate the row via
`POST /messages`, does not `DELETE FROM message`, and does not unlink
media, invoices, zap receipts, Nostr, text, or photo.

Same debug token gate as `GET /debug/messages`.

`DEBUG_TOKEN` unset or blank → **Response** `503`:

```json
{ "error": "Debug is not configured" }
```

Missing or non-matching bearer → **Response** `401`:

```json
{ "error": "Unauthorized" }
```

Non-UUID or unknown id → **Response** `404`:

```json
{ "error": "Not found" }
```

Store throw → **Response** `503`:

```json
{ "error": "Messages are unavailable" }
```

Success (hidden or already-live existing id) → **Response** `204` with an
empty body. Public `GET /messages/:id` can then serve the note. Logs
`debug.messages.restored` with `{ messageId }` only (never text, never
`deletedBy`). Store throw logs `debug.messages.restore_failed`. Used by
`gifts-debug restore`.

### `GET /push/vapid-public`

Bearer session. Returns the VAPID **public** key the browser needs for
`pushManager.subscribe`. Missing VAPID env → **503** after session check
(the process still boots). No cookies.

No/invalid session → **Response** `401`:

```json
{ "error": "Unauthorized" }
```

VAPID not configured → **Response** `503`:

```json
{ "error": "Push is not configured" }
```

Success → **Response** `200`:

```json
{ "publicKey": "<url-safe-base64>" }
```

### `POST /me/push-subscriptions`

Bearer session. Upserts a browser PushSubscription for the account
(`endpoint` unique; rebinds if another account held it).

No/invalid session → **401** `{ "error": "Unauthorized" }`.
VAPID not configured → **503** `{ "error": "Push is not configured" }`.
Invalid body (`endpoint` not an https URL, or missing `keys.p256dh` /
`keys.auth`) → **400** `{ "error": "Invalid subscription" }`.

Success → **Response** `200`:

```json
{ "endpoint": "https://push.example/device", "createdAt": "2026-08-30T12:00:00.000Z" }
```

### `DELETE /me/push-subscriptions`

Bearer session. Body `{ "endpoint": "https://…" }`. Removes that device
for this account only.

No/invalid session → **401**. VAPID not configured → **503**. Missing or
blank `endpoint` → **400** `{ "error": "Invalid subscription" }`. Unknown
endpoint for this account → **404** `{ "error": "Not found" }`.

Success → **Response** `200`:

```json
{ "ok": true }
```

### `POST /debug/push-ping`

Operator enqueue of a test notification. Authenticated with
`Authorization: Bearer` matching `DEBUG_TOKEN` (not an end-user session).
JSON body `{ "accountId": "<uuid>" }`. Enqueues at most one outbox row
when the account has a stored subscription.

`DEBUG_TOKEN` unset or blank → **503** `{ "error": "Debug is not configured" }`.
Missing or non-matching bearer → **401** `{ "error": "Unauthorized" }`.
VAPID not configured → **503** `{ "error": "Push is not configured" }`.
Missing `accountId` → **400** `{ "error": "Expected a JSON body with an \"accountId\" string" }`.
Unknown account → **404** `{ "error": "Not found" }`.

Success → **Response** `200`:

```json
{ "enqueued": 1 }
```

`enqueued` is `0` when the account has no subscription.

### `GET /gifts`

Public list of outbound gifts for one UTC calendar day. Query `day=YYYY-MM-DD`.
No auth. The body never includes invoices, fees, or wallet identifiers.

Missing, blank, or impossible `day` (`2026-02-31`) → **400**
`{ "error": "Expected a UTC day (YYYY-MM-DD)" }`.

When `DATABASE_URL` is unset the in-memory gift store is empty — **200** with
zeros (`totalUsd` / `totalChf` / `totalEur` / `totalPhp` `"0.00"`), `gifts: []`,
and `fx` with USD-only `quotes` (no Coinbase / Frankfurter). When gifts exist
for that day, the api ensures a BTC-USD close for that UTC day and converts
each gift at **that day's** close. CHF/EUR/PHP are USD × that UTC day's
Frankfurter ECB rate (last business day if closed). An empty matching set is
200 without Coinbase or Frankfurter. A query failure or a still-missing
BTC-USD rate is **503**. A missing CHF/EUR/PHP cross is JSON `null` on the
matching total and per-gift amount, never 503.

**Response** `200` (empty day):

```json
{
  "day": "2026-06-01",
  "giftCount": 0,
  "totalSats": 0,
  "totalBtc": "0.00000000",

  }
}
```

**Response** `200` (one gift; 1000 sats at BTC-USD 100000 and CHF 0.80 / EUR 0.90 / PHP 50):

**Response** `503`: `{ "error": "Gift stats are unavailable" }` (store failure or missing BTC-USD only; missing fiat is never 503).

### `GET /gifts/stats`

Public aggregated outbound gift statistics. No auth. The body never includes
invoices, fees, or wallet identifiers.

When `DATABASE_URL` is unset the in-memory gift and FX stores are empty —
**200** with zeros, empty series, `totalBtc` `"0.00000000"`, `totalUsd` /
`totalChf` / `totalEur` / `totalPhp` `"0.00"`, and `fx` with USD-only
`quotes` (no Coinbase / Frankfurter call). When it is set, the process
queries the `gift` table (`paid_at`, `amount_sats`, `recipient_wos_user`
only) and ensures a BTC-USD daily close for each gift's UTC calendar day
(from `btc_usd_daily`, fetching Coinbase only for missing days / stale
UTC-today / after-midnight finalize of an intraday print). Each gift's sats
are converted at **that day's** close (not spot). CHF/EUR/PHP are USD × that
UTC day's Frankfurter ECB rate (last business day if closed; persisted in
`usd_fiat_daily`). A gift day that lacks a cross returns that currency as
JSON `null`; a running total goes `null` if any selected gift lacks that
cross. Gap days in `spendOverTime` are zero sats/BTC/USD and `"0.00"` fiat
and need no rate. Gap months in `byMonth` are zero sats/BTC/USD and
`"0.00"` fiat and need no rate.
A query failure or a still-missing BTC-USD rate after ensure is **503**.
A missing CHF/EUR/PHP cross is never 503.

Optional query `recipient` filters to one Wallet of Satoshi handle
(case-insensitive). The value is trimmed first. When the trimmed value
contains `@` after the first character, the local-part before `@` is used;
otherwise the whole trimmed string is the handle. Missing or blank
(after trim) `recipient` is unfiltered.
An unknown handle is empty **200** (zeros, USD-only `fx.quotes`) without a
Coinbase or Frankfurter call. Rates are ensured only for the selected
gifts' UTC days.

**Response** `200`:

**Response** `503`:

```json
{ "error": "Gift stats are unavailable" }
```

503 is store failure or missing BTC-USD only. Missing CHF/EUR/PHP is JSON
`null`, never 503.

### `GET /invoices/passkey`

Spend-worker eligibility check. Query `address=name@domain.tld`. Same
`SPEND_API_TOKEN` Bearer as `POST /invoices` (503 unconfigured / 401
unauthorized).

Missing or invalid Lightning Address → **400**
`{ "error": "Not a valid Lightning Address (expected name@domain)" }`.

Success is always **200** (never 404 for an unknown address):

```json
{ "hasPasskey": true }
```

or `{ "hasPasskey": false }` when there is no account for the address or the
account has no passkey credential.

### `GET /invoices/posted`

Spend-worker eligibility check. Query `address=name@domain.tld`. Same
`SPEND_API_TOKEN` Bearer as `POST /invoices` (503 unconfigured / 401
unauthorized).

Missing or invalid Lightning Address → **400**
`{ "error": "Not a valid Lightning Address (expected name@domain)" }`.

Success is always **200** (never 404 for an unknown address):

```json
{ "hasPosted": true, "messageId": "<uuid>", "postedAt": "<iso-8601>" }
```

or `{ "hasPosted": false, "messageId": null, "postedAt": null }` when there is no account for the
address or the account has no live **top-level** forum message other than the
auto-created profile note. Replies do not count. Photo-only / empty-text
top-level notes still count. When `hasPosted` is true, `messageId` is usually
the newest live top-level non-profile post id; it can still be `null` if
`listPostsByAccount` yields no non-profile row. `postedAt` is that row's
`createdAt` (ISO-8601) or `null` when `messageId` is null. Replies and the auto profile
note never become `messageId`.

### `POST /invoices`

Spend-worker invoice fetch. After address and amount validation, the api
requires a 21.gifts account for `address` that already has a passkey
credential and at least one live **top-level** forum message that is not the
auto-created profile note. Replies do not unlock an invoice. It then resolves
LUD-16, GETs the LNURL-pay callback, decodes the BOLT11, and stores
`{ id, pr, paymentHash }` in memory. It does not pay.

**Body:**

```json
{ "address": "name@domain.tld", "amountMsat": 100000, "comment": "optional", "messageId": "<uuid>" }
```

`comment` is optional and at most 255 characters. `amountMsat` must be an
integer in `1000..10000000000`. `messageId` is optional (current spend without
the field still works). Invalid UUID → **400**
`{ "error": "Expected a JSON body with address and amountMsat" }`. When set,
the post must be that address's live top-level non-profile note (else **403**
`Forum post required` before LNURL). Missing `isPlatform` account → **503**
`{ "error": "Platform account is not configured" }` (no LNURL). Stores
`messageId` and `comment` (or `''`) on the invoice.

When `SPEND_API_TOKEN` is unset or blank:

**Response** `503`:

```json
{ "error": "Spend invoices are not configured" }
```

Missing or wrong `Authorization: Bearer` → **401** `{ "error": "Unauthorized" }`.

Bad JSON, `amountMsat` outside `1000..10000000000`, `comment` longer than
255, or invalid `messageId` UUID → **400**
`{ "error": "Expected a JSON body with address and amountMsat" }`.

Invalid Lightning Address → **400**
`{ "error": "Not a valid Lightning Address (expected name@domain)" }`.

No account for the address, or the account has no passkey credential →
**403** (before any LNURL fetch; no invoice is stored):

```json
{ "error": "Passkey required" }
```

The account has a passkey but no live **top-level** forum message other than
the auto-created profile note, or `messageId` is set but is not that
address's live top-level non-profile note → **403** (after the passkey check,
before any LNURL fetch; no invoice is stored):

```json
{ "error": "Forum post required" }
```

Missing `isPlatform` account (when `messageId` is set) → **503** (before any
LNURL fetch; no invoice is stored):

```json
{ "error": "Platform account is not configured" }
```

LNURL-pay failure, decode failure, or invoice amount mismatch → **502**:

```json
{ "error": "Lightning Address did not issue an invoice" }
```

Success → **Response** `200`:

```json
{
  "id": "<32 hex>",
  "pr": "lnbc…",
  "paymentHash": "<64 hex>",
  "amountMsat": 100000
}
```

Unpaid invoices expire after 15 minutes (`GIFT_INVOICE_TTL_MS`). A later
`POST /invoices` sweeps unpaid rows after expiry plus one extra TTL; until
then a matching preimage still proves payment. Restart clears the store.

### `POST /invoices/proof`

Spend-worker proof. Body `{ "id", "preimage" }`. Proof is the **preimage**;
`sha256(preimage)` must equal the stored payment hash.

Same 503/401 as `POST /invoices` when unconfigured or unauthorized.

Bad JSON or missing `id`/`preimage` → **400**
`{ "error": "Expected a JSON body with id and preimage" }`.

Unknown id → **404** `{ "error": "Invoice not found" }` (including after
sweep/restart). Matching preimage →
**200** even after the 15-minute unpaid TTL, as long as the row is still in
memory. Expired unpaid **without** a matching preimage → **409**
`{ "error": "Invoice expired" }`. Hash mismatch on an unexpired invoice →
**400** `{ "error": "Proof does not match invoice" }`. Already paid with a
different preimage → **409** `{ "error": "Invoice already paid" }`. Same
preimage → **200** idempotent.

A matching proof (including the same-preimage idempotent 200) inserts one
outbound `gift` row when `DATABASE_URL` is set: BOLT11 `pr` as
`lightning_invoice`, amount `floor(msat / 1000)` sats, fee 0, recipient
handle from the invoice address, description `21gifts daily`,
`source_wallet` `lightning.space`. Without SQL the recorder is a no-op.
Insert errors log `gifts.record_failed` and do not change the HTTP
response.

When the invoice has `messageId`, the api inserts a platform-account
gift-reply first (name trimmed or `21.gifts`, text = comment, `parentId` =
`messageId`, same visual as a zap gift-reply), then `addSats(floor(msat/1000))`
on that post. Repeat proof with the same preimage is idempotent (existing
reply id skips `addSats`). Parent missing/deleted or platform missing: skip
attach, log `invoice.gift_reply.failed`, still **200** + gift persist.

Success → **Response** `200`:

```json
{ "status": "paid", "id": "<id>", "paymentHash": "<64 hex>" }
```

### `GET /messages`

Public member forum thread. Bearer session required. After auth,
`requireAction(account, 'forum.read')` (rules). Returns **only
top-level notes** (`parent_id IS NULL`) newest first (`createdAt`
descending, then `id`), capped at **200**. Replies are never listed here —
use `GET /messages/:id/replies`. This is the latest-200 **window** on the
wire; clients must render the thread as a **messenger group** (oldest at
the top, newest at the bottom above the composer), reversing the array for
display. Each message exposes the author **name snapshotted at post time**,
`text` (may be empty when a photo or video is attached), ISO-8601
`createdAt`, `sats` (validated Lightning receipts on that note, default 0),
`payable` (true when the note is signed and the author has a Lightning
Address), `hasPhoto`, `hasVideo`, `videoContentType` (`null` when
`hasVideo` is false), live `role` (the author's current `account.role`, or
`"basis"` if the author is missing; omitted for Damus-only authors), and
`replyCount` of live 21.gifts-author children (`parent_id` match,
`deleted_at` null, `account_id IS NOT NULL`). Damus-only children do not
increment it. List JSON never includes photo
or video bytes. Signed-in list/replies/create may include `accountId`
(21gifts author id; omitted for Damus-only top-level notes); public GET `/messages/:id`
never includes it. Nostr event ids are never included in the JSON.

Missing/invalid/expired bearer → **Response** `401`:

```json
{ "error": "Unauthorized" }
```

Missing rules → **Response** `409`:

```json
{ "error": "missing_requirements", "missing": ["rules"] }
```

Store failure → **Response** `503`:

```json
{ "error": "Messages are unavailable" }
```

Success → **Response** `200`:

```json
{
  "messages": [
    {
      "id": "<uuid>",
      "name": "Ada",
      "text": "Thank you!",
      "createdAt": "2026-08-28T12:00:00.000Z",
      "sats": 0,
      "payable": false,
      "hasPhoto": false,
      "hasVideo": false,
      "videoContentType": null,
      "role": "basis",
      "replyCount": 0
    }
  ]
}
```

An empty thread is **200** with `"messages": []`. When `DATABASE_URL` is
unset the default in-memory store starts empty; when set, rows come from
Postgres `message`. List queries select top-level rows only
(`parent_id IS NULL`), `(photo IS NOT NULL) AS has_photo`, and a
`replyCount` of live 21.gifts-author children (`account_id IS NOT NULL`),
and must not select the `photo` bytea
column.

The nostr worker, each tick, queries zap relays (space plus the public
list, including when `NOSTR_PUBLISH_PUBLIC` is unset) for kind:9735
receipts whose `e` tag matches a recent note `event_id`. A receipt is
indexed when the signer pubkey matches the author's LNURL-pay
`nostrPubkey`, the bolt11 amount is at least 1 sat, and the receipt id
is new. Indexed receipts increment that row's `sats` (GET /messages then
returns the new total). Kind:1 EVENT frames published to relays are JSON
objects, not JSON strings. Inbound kind:1 `#e` replies are persisted only
when the pubkey maps to a 21.gifts account; unknown npubs are skipped
(they stay on Nostr).

### `POST /messages`

Post to the public member forum. Bearer session required. JSON body (not
multipart) with text and/or one photo, and an optional parent UUID:

```json
{ "text": "…", "inReplyTo": "<uuid>", "photo": { "contentType": "image/jpeg", "data": "<base64>" } }
```

`{ "text": "hello" }` without `photo` remains valid. Photo-only posts are
allowed (`text` may be omitted or empty when a photo is present). At least
one of (non-empty trimmed text, photo) is required. Optional `inReplyTo`
is a **top-level** parent message UUID (JSON only; sets `parentId` for a
one-level NIP-10 reply). Missing or non-UUID `inReplyTo`, a parent that
is not in the store, or a parent that is itself a reply (`parentId` not
null) → **404** `{ "error": "Not found" }`. A valid parent where the
caller is neither the parent author nor `moderator`/`founder`/`verified` → **403**
`{ "error": "A reply needs a Bitcoin payment" }` (pay via
`POST /messages/:id/invoice` instead). Multipart video posts do not
accept `inReplyTo` (they are always top-level).

After auth, `requireAction(account, 'forum.post')` requires rules agreement,
a non-blank display name, and a non-blank Lightning Address (skip timestamps
do not satisfy). The api stores a **name snapshot** (trimmed account name at
post time), normalised text (possibly `""` for photo-only), optional
JPEG/PNG/WebP bytes (≤ 1 MiB; MIME from magic bytes), `parentId` (null for
top-level notes), and a timestamp. Text longer than **500** after trim, or
with disallowed C0/DEL controls, is rejected. Newlines (`\n`, `\r`) are
allowed. The **200** body is the public message object itself (not wrapped
in `{ messages }`), including `sats`, `payable`, `hasPhoto`, `hasVideo`, and
`videoContentType`. May include `accountId` (21gifts author id). No
`replyCount`, and no photo or video bytes in the JSON. `sats` is 0 and
`payable` is false until the worker signs the note (and stays false without
author LN). `role` is the posting session account's live `account.role`. Web Push and in-app rows for a **top-level** note (`notifyForumPost`, kind
`forum_post`, `url` `/notifications`, `tag` `forum_post:<id>`) and for a
**reply** (`notifyForumReply`, kind `forum_reply`, `url` `/notifications`,
`tag` `forum_reply:<replyId>`) fan out in-app to every account except the
actor, then filter recipients by each account's `notificationLevel`
(`all` / `active` / `mentions`). Web Push still goes only to bell subscribers
and uses the same level filter. Damus-only parents still
fan out. A self-reply skips only the actor. `GET /notifications` lists stored
rows unfiltered.
The booted process always has notification and push stores (in-memory without
`DATABASE_URL`, Postgres when it is set). Photo-only empty text still
notifies. Missing `pushStore` still writes in-app rows. Notification or
push failure does not fail the **200**. Over-limit posters
get **429** `{ "error": "Too many messages" }`
with `Retry-After: 10` (1/10s, 6/h, 20/UTC-day). A second **live** photo/video
POST with the same account, parent, normalised text, and media bytes returns
**200** with the existing row (no extra burst slot, no second top-level push).
Text-only posts are unchanged (still **429** on burst). After a **new**
top-level persist, the api POSTs `{ address, messageId }` to `{SPEND_URL}/ping` with
Bearer `SPEND_API_TOKEN` (fire-and-await; `messageId` is the UUID of the new
top-level row). Errors are logged; the POST still
returns **200**. Replies do not ping. Idempotent media replay does not ping
again. Unset or blank `SPEND_URL` or `SPEND_API_TOKEN` skips the ping; the
process still boots. The worker signs a
top-level kind:1 (content includes Damus-visible `#bitcoin` and `#21gifts`, and when the author's `location` is non-null also `#<locationHashtagName>` plus a `t` tag (not on the profile note);
forum `text` stays the member's words) and fans out when `NOSTR_PUBLISH=1`.

Missing/invalid/expired bearer → **Response** `401`:

```json
{ "error": "Unauthorized" }
```

Missing required fields → **Response** `409`:

```json
{ "error": "missing_requirements", "missing": ["rules", "name", "lightning-address"] }
```

(`missing` is never empty; order is `rules`, then `name`, then
`lightning-address`. A named, rules-agreed account with null LN yields
`["lightning-address"]` only.)

Body is not JSON with `text` and/or `photo` → **Response** `400`:

```json
{ "error": "Expected a JSON body with text and/or photo" }
```

Text longer than 500 after trim, or contains a disallowed control →
**Response** `400`:

```json
{ "error": "Text must be 1–500 characters" }
```

Whitespace-only / empty text with no photo → **Response** `400`:

```json
{ "error": "Text must be 1–500 characters or include a photo" }
```

`photo` present but invalid base64, wrong magic (not JPEG/PNG/WebP), empty,
or decoded size `> 1_048_576` → **Response** `400`:

```json
{ "error": "Photo must be a JPEG, PNG, or WebP under 1 MiB" }
```

`inReplyTo` present but not a UUID, the parent is missing, or the parent
is itself a reply →
**Response** `404`:

```json
{ "error": "Not found" }
```

Valid parent, but the caller is not the parent author and not
`moderator`/`founder`/`verified` →
**Response** `403`:

```json
{ "error": "A reply needs a Bitcoin payment" }
```

Store failure → **Response** `503`:

```json
{ "error": "Messages are unavailable" }
```

Success → **Response** `200`:

```json
{
  "id": "<uuid>",
  "name": "Ada",
  "text": "Thank you!",
  "createdAt": "2026-08-28T12:00:00.000Z",
  "sats": 0,
  "payable": false,
  "hasPhoto": false,
  "hasVideo": false,
  "videoContentType": null,
  "role": "basis"
}
```

### `POST /messages/:id/invoice`

Signed-in pay-on-note. Bearer session required. `:id` is a UUID (`MESSAGE_ID_RE`).
Body `{ "sats": <int 1..10_000_000>, "text"?: "<string>" }`. Optional `text` is the
NIP-57 zap-request `content` (same 1–500 forum rules; omit or whitespace = gift-only).
Invalid `text` → **400** `{ "error": "Text must be 1–500 characters" }`.
The api signs a NIP-57 zap request with the
**payer** key and returns a BOLT11 invoice for the **author** Lightning Address
**only** when the minted invoice's `description_hash` equals SHA-256 of the
zap-request JSON (`isNip57Invoice`). A validated kind:9735 receipt still increments
the **parent** `sats`. After that increment (never in the same SQL CTE), the worker
inserts a reply from the payer (`text` from the zap-request comment or `""`,
`sats` = this zap). Gift-only replies (`text === ""`) stay `nostrPublishState`
`skipped` (no kind:1). Parent `sats` is the aggregate; reply `sats` is this gift.
After a newly indexed receipt, `notifyZap` runs best-effort (in-app rows for
every account except the resolved payer, then filtered by each account's
`notificationLevel`; Web Push only to bell subscribers with the same filter;
missing `pushStore` still writes in-app rows when `auth` is set; enqueue
failure logs `push.enqueue.failed`). `GET /notifications` lists stored rows
unfiltered. LNURL success with a non-NIP-57 invoice
(plaintext description, missing/mismatched `description_hash`, or malformed
BOLT11) → persist `not_zap` (with rejected `pr` for debug) and **400**
`{ "error": "The author's wallet cannot receive this Bitcoin payment" }` with
**no** `pr` in the body. LNURL `noZap` (author wallet does not advertise zap
receive) → same author's-wallet **400** (persist `noZap`, `pr` null). Other
LNURL/zap transport failures (`unreachable`) → **400**
`{ "error": "Could not start the Bitcoin payment" }`. It does **not** increment
`sats` (that happens when a validated kind:9735 receipt is indexed). After auth,
every attempt with a valid UUID is persisted best-effort to `message_invoice`
(result, HTTP status, `pr`, description vs `description_hash`,
`isNip57Invoice`). Store failures log `message.invoice.record_failed` and do
not change the HTTP response. A non-UUID `:id` is **404** without a persist row.

Success → **Response** `200`:

```json
{ "pr": "lnbc…", "amountSats": 21 }
```

Missing Bearer → **401** `{ "error": "Unauthorized" }`.
Payer missing living-room rules → **409** `{ "error": "missing_requirements", "missing": ["rules"] }`.
Malformed body or `sats` above 10 million → **400** `{ "error": "Expected a JSON body with a positive \"sats\" integer" }`.
Unknown id → **404** `{ "error": "Not found" }`. Unsigned note, author without a Lightning Address, or missing recipient pubkey →
**400** `{ "error": "This message cannot be paid yet" }`. Missing KEK →
**503** `{ "error": "Messages are unavailable" }` (before the limiter).
Over-limit → **429** `{ "error": "Too many payments" }` (`Retry-After: 10`) —
checked only after auth, amount, payable, and KEK checks succeed, so early
400/404/401/503 do not consume quota. LNURL/zap or sign failure after the
limiter still counts. Author-wallet zap failure (`noZap` or `not_zap`) →
**400** `{ "error": "The author's wallet cannot receive this Bitcoin payment" }`.
Other LNURL/zap failure (`unreachable`) →
**400** `{ "error": "Could not start the Bitcoin payment" }`. Keygen/sign failure →
**503** `{ "error": "Messages are unavailable" }`.

### `GET /messages/:id/photo`

Fetch the optional photo bytes for one forum message. **No bearer** — Damus
loads this URL from kind:1 `imeta`. Missing message, message-without-photo,
and a non-UUID `id` are the same **404** (Postgres would otherwise throw on
`uuid` and become 503).

No photo for `id` → **Response** `404`:

```json
{ "error": "Photo not found" }
```

Store failure → **Response** `503`:

```json
{ "error": "Messages are unavailable" }
```

Success → **Response** `200`: raw image body, `Content-Type` one of
`image/jpeg` / `image/png` / `image/webp` (from stored magic-derived type),
`Cache-Control: public, max-age=86400`. Not JSON.

Photo, video, and replies register **before** the public single-note
`GET /messages/:id` so `/photo`, `/video.mp4` (and `.webm` / `.mov`), and
`/replies` are not captured as an `:id`.

### `GET /messages/:id/video.mp4`

Fetch optional video bytes for one forum message (same handler for
`.webm` and `.mov`). **No bearer** — Damus loads this URL from kind:1
`imeta`. Missing message, message-without-video, extension that does not
match the stored MIME, and a non-UUID `id` are the same **404**. Supports
`Range` / HTTP **206** and **416** (`Content-Range: bytes */SIZE`).

No video for `id` → **Response** `404`:

```json
{ "error": "Video not found" }
```

Store failure → **Response** `503`:

```json
{ "error": "Messages are unavailable" }
```

Success → **Response** `200` or `206`: raw video body,
`Content-Type` one of `video/mp4` / `video/webm` / `video/quicktime`,
`Accept-Ranges: bytes`, `Cache-Control: public, max-age=86400`,
`Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *`. Not JSON.

### `GET /messages/:id/replies`

Public (Bearer optional). Lists **direct live 21.gifts-author replies**
(`account_id IS NOT NULL`) for parent `:id` oldest-first (`createdAt`
then `id` ascending), capped at **200**. Unknown-npub (Damus-only)
children are omitted. Each item is the public message JSON with
`payable` false and no `replyCount`. Unauthenticated items omit
`accountId`; signed-in replies include `accountId` (21gifts author id).
Photo and video bytes are never included. `:id` is a UUID
(`MESSAGE_ID_RE`).

`:id` is not a UUID, the parent is missing, or the parent is soft-hidden
→ **Response** `404`:

```json
{ "error": "Not found" }
```

Store failure → **Response** `503`:

```json
{ "error": "Messages are unavailable" }
```

Success → **Response** `200`:

```json
{
  "messages": [
    {
      "id": "<uuid>",
      "name": "Ada",
      "text": "A reply",
      "createdAt": "2026-08-28T12:01:00.000Z",
      "sats": 0,
      "payable": false,
      "hasPhoto": false,
      "hasVideo": false,
      "videoContentType": null,
      "role": "basis"
    }
  ]
}
```

An empty reply thread is **200** with `"messages": []`. Soft-hidden
and Damus-only children (`accountId` null) are omitted from the list.

### `GET /messages/:id`

Public single-note fetch. **No Bearer.** `:id` is a UUID. Registered
**after** photo, video, `GET /messages/:id/replies`,
`DELETE /messages/:id`, and `GET /messages/hidden` so those paths are not
captured as `:id`. Returns
the public message JSON (`sats`, `payable`, `hasPhoto`, `hasVideo`,
`videoContentType`; live `role` for 21gifts authors). Never includes
`accountId`, `deletedAt`, or `deletedBy`. Top-level Damus-only notes
(`accountId` null, `parentId` null) omit `role` and set `payable` false.
A live Damus-only **reply** (`parentId` set, `accountId` null) is **404**
`{ "error": "Not found" }` (same body as missing/hidden). `replyCount` is
omitted. Photo and video bytes are never included. Soft-hidden rows
(`deletedAt` set) are treated as missing (404) before any missing-video
hard-delete cleanup.

Optional query `sinceSats` (non-negative integer string, `/^\d+$/`):
long-polls until that note's `sats` is **strictly greater than** `n`, then
returns the same **200** public JSON as an immediate GET. First read may
return immediately when `sats` is already higher. `sats === n` keeps
waiting. Timeout (~25s) still returns **200** with the current body (never
204/202/304); the client retries. Absent `sinceSats` is unchanged
immediate GET. Invalid `sinceSats` (`-1`, `1.5`, `abc`, empty, `+1`,
whitespace) → **400** after the UUID check (non-UUID `:id` stays **404**
even when `sinceSats` is present). Soft-hidden / missing during the wait
(including the first read) → **404**. Store throw on any read → **503**.

Non-UUID `:id`, missing row, soft-hidden row, or live Damus-only reply →
**Response** `404`:

```json
{ "error": "Not found" }
```

Invalid `sinceSats` → **Response** `400`:

```json
{ "error": "Expected sinceSats to be a non-negative integer" }
```

Store failure → **Response** `503`:

```json
{ "error": "Messages are unavailable" }
```

Success (including `sinceSats` timeout with unchanged sats) → **Response**
`200`:

```json
{
  "id": "<uuid>",
  "name": "Ada",
  "text": "Thank you!",
  "createdAt": "2026-08-28T12:00:00.000Z",
  "sats": 0,
  "payable": false,
  "hasPhoto": false,
  "hasVideo": false,
  "videoContentType": null,
  "role": "basis"
}
```

### `DELETE /messages/:id`

Staff soft-hide. Bearer session required. Live role must be `founder` or
`moderator` (authors with `basis` / `verified` get 403 even on their own
post). Stamps `deleted_at` / `deleted_by` on the target row and every
**direct** reply that is not yet tagged. Does **not** hard-delete the
Postgres row, photo bytes, on-disk video, invoices, zap receipts, or gift
records; does **not** call `deleteById` / `DELETE FROM message`. Already
tagged targets keep their original stamps and still return 204.
`getById` continues to return tagged rows for workers; public/member HTTP
reads treat them as missing.

Missing/invalid/expired bearer → **Response** `401`:

```json
{ "error": "Unauthorized" }
```

Live role is not founder and not moderator → **Response** `403`:

```json
{ "error": "Forbidden" }
```

`:id` is not a UUID, or no row with that id → **Response** `404`:

```json
{ "error": "Not found" }
```

Success (including already tagged) → **Response** `204` empty body.

Store failure → **Response** `503`:

```json
{ "error": "Messages are unavailable" }
```

On success the process logs `messages.deleted` with `messageId`,
`accountId`, and the staff `role` (never the post text). On store throw
it logs `messages.delete.failed`.

### `GET /messages/hidden`

Staff hidden-note log. Inverse **read** of `DELETE /messages/:id`. Bearer
**session** required (founder or moderator). This is **not** a
`DEBUG_TOKEN` route. Registered **before** public `GET /messages/:id` so
`"hidden"` is not captured as `:id`. No `forum.read` gate — a
founder/moderator without rules agreement is still **200**.

Lists only rows with `deletedAt` set, newest-hidden first (`deletedAt`
desc, then `id` desc), capped at **200**. JSON `{ "messages": [ … ] }`
via `serializeHiddenMessage`. Each item includes stored `name` (no
empty-name pubkey fallback), ISO `createdAt` / `deletedAt`, `hasPhoto` /
`hasVideo` / `videoContentType`, always-present `parentId` (JSON `null`
on top-level), and `deletedBy: { id, name, role }` resolved from
`authStore.getAccount` (missing account keeps that id with `name` /
`role` null; null `deletedBy` is `{ id: null, name: null, role: null }`).
Never includes `accountId`, `eventId`, `nostrPublishState`, `payable`,
author `role`, `nostrEvent`, `claimedUntil`, `contentFp`, nsec, or
photo/video bytes. Public list/GET/photo stay **404** for hidden rows.
No staff UNHIDE session route (`POST /debug/messages/:id/restore` remains
`DEBUG_TOKEN` only).

Missing/invalid/expired bearer → **Response** `401`:

```json
{ "error": "Unauthorized" }
```

Live role is not founder and not moderator → **Response** `403`:

```json
{ "error": "Forbidden" }
```

Store, deleter lookup, or serialize throw → **Response** `503`:

```json
{ "error": "Messages are unavailable" }
```

Success (including an empty list) → **Response** `200`:

```json
{
  "messages": [
    {
      "id": "<uuid>",
      "name": "Ada",
      "text": "hidden",
      "createdAt": "2026-08-28T12:00:00.000Z",
      "sats": 0,
      "hasPhoto": false,
      "hasVideo": false,
      "videoContentType": null,
      "parentId": null,
      "deletedAt": "2026-09-01T12:00:00.000Z",
      "deletedBy": { "id": "<uuid>", "name": "Ada", "role": "moderator" }
    }
  ]
}
```

On success the process logs `messages.hidden.listed` with `{ count }`
only (never post text, never message ids). On throw it logs
`messages.hidden.list_failed`.

### `POST /contact`

Private in-app contact mailbox. Bearer session required. Body:

```json
{ "text": "…" }
```

The account must already have a non-blank display name. The api stores a
**name snapshot** (trimmed account name at post time), the normalised text,
and a timestamp. Text goes through `normalizeForumText` (newlines `\n`/`\r`
allowed; other C0 and DEL rejected), then contact still requires trimmed
length **1–500**. Forum photo-only empty text is not accepted here. The
**200** body is the public contact object itself (not wrapped). No
`accountId` in the member-facing JSON. Contacts are **never** listed
publicly — operators still read the mailbox via `GET /debug/contacts`
(`DEBUG_TOKEN` must not read member PNs). After the platform account exists,
the contact row is persisted first, then the same text is appended to the
member→platform conversation thread so it is readable via
`GET /conversations`. Conversation append failure logs
`conversations.contact_sync.failed` and still returns **200** (contact is
the product surface). When no platform account (`isPlatform`) exists
(neither contact nor thread is written) →
**Response** `503`:

```json
{ "error": "Platform account is not configured" }
```

No email. Outbound Nostr fan-out is the conversation worker (NIP-17 wrap),
not this HTTP handler.

Missing/invalid/expired bearer → **Response** `401`:

```json
{ "error": "Unauthorized" }
```

Body is not JSON with a `text` string → **Response** `400`:

```json
{ "error": "Expected a JSON body with a \"text\" string" }
```

Missing required fields (`requireAction` `contact.post`) → **Response** `409`:

```json
{ "error": "missing_requirements", "missing": ["rules", "name"] }
```

Text empty, longer than 500 after trim, or contains a disallowed control →
**Response** `400`:

```json
{ "error": "Text must be 1–500 characters" }
```

Store failure → **Response** `503`:

```json
{ "error": "Contact is unavailable" }
```

Success → **Response** `200`:

```json
{
  "id": "<uuid>",
  "name": "Ada",
  "text": "Hello",
  "createdAt": "2026-08-29T12:00:00.000Z"
}
```

### `GET /conversations`

Bearer session required. Nothing public. Lists threads the session may see:
own member↔member / member↔Damus / member↔platform threads, plus (when
`role` is `founder` or `moderator`) every platform thread. Empty threads
and outbound-only member/Damus threads (every stored sender is
`conversationFromMe` for the viewer, including staff-as-platform) are
omitted. The member's own `member_platform` contact thread is listed when
it has a message, even if outbound-only. Damus inbound (null sender) is
inbound and listed. This list never includes `moderator_group` (even for
`role === 'moderator'`). The closed group is `GET /conversations/moderator-group`
only. `GET /conversations/:id` and
`POST` still return/open outbound-only and empty threads. Newest
`lastMessageAt` first. Cap 200. List/open rows may include optional
`accountId` of the counterpart 21.gifts account (omitted for Damus-only
counterparts). Member JSON never includes event ids or npubs; Damus-only
counterpart `name` may be a truncated npub.

Missing/invalid/expired bearer → **Response** `401`:

```json
{ "error": "Unauthorized" }
```

Store failure → **Response** `503`:

```json
{ "error": "Conversations are unavailable" }
```

Success → **Response** `200`:

```json
{
  "conversations": [
    {
      "id": "<uuid>",
      "kind": "member_member",
      "name": "Ada",
      "lastText": "Hello",
      "lastAt": "2026-08-29T12:00:00.000Z",
      "lastFromMe": false,
      "lastSats": 0,
      "accountId": "<uuid>"
    }
  ]
}
```

`accountId` is the counterpart 21.gifts account. It is omitted for
Damus-only counterparts (never JSON `null`).

### `GET /conversations/moderator-group`

Bearer session required. Confirmed moderators (`role === 'moderator'`
only) open or insert the closed singleton and receive it as
`{ "conversation": { ... } }` (same public row as a list item, `kind`
`moderator_group`, `name` `Moderators`). Founder / verified / basis get
**404** `{ "error": "Not found" }` (no existence leak). Missing platform
account or store failure → **503** `{ "error": "Conversations are unavailable" }`.
Unauthenticated → **401**.

### `POST /conversations`

Bearer session required. Open or return the thread with a forum note's
author (`21gifts` account or Damus pubkey). Body:

```json
{ "forumMessageId": "<uuid>" }
```

Unknown / non-UUID note → **404** `{ "error": "Not found" }`. Author is
the session account → **400** `{ "error": "Cannot message yourself" }`.

Success → **Response** `200` (same public conversation object as list
rows, including optional counterpart `accountId`).

### `GET /conversations/:id`

Bearer session required. `:id` is a UUID. Messages oldest-first (cap 200).
The envelope is `{ "messages": [...] }` only (no counterpart `accountId`
on the thread). Each message may include optional sender `accountId`.
**404** `{ "error": "Not found" }` when the id is not a UUID, the thread is
missing, or the session may not see it. Kind includes `moderator_group`;
founder / verified / basis get **404** `{ "error": "Not found" }` on that
id (no existence leak). Moderators only.

Optional query `sinceMessageId` (UUID): long-polls until that message id is in
the thread (pay-sheet confirmation). Timeout still **200** with the current
messages (the id may be absent). Invalid value → **400**
`{ "error": "Expected sinceMessageId to be a UUID" }`. Missing/forbidden
thread → **404** immediately.

Success → **Response** `200`:

```json
{
  "messages": [
    {
      "id": "<uuid>",
      "name": "Ada",
      "text": "Hello",
      "createdAt": "2026-08-29T12:00:00.000Z",
      "fromMe": true,
      "sats": 0,
      "accountId": "<uuid>"
    }
  ]
}
```

`accountId` is the sender 21.gifts account. It is omitted when
`senderAccountId` is null (Damus inbound; never JSON `null`).
List rows also include `lastSats` (0 when the last message is unpaid text).

### `POST /conversations/:id`

Bearer session required. Body `{ "text": "…" }` 1–500 via
`normalizeForumText`. Staff (`founder` \| `moderator`) replies on a
platform thread persist as the platform account; the worker signs with the
platform nsec. Relay failure does not block local persist. Kind includes
`moderator_group`: persist as the moderator account with
`nostrPublishState` skipped (never Nostr). After a new persist on
`moderator_group`, ping `{ address, kind: "moderator" }` (no `messageId`
in the HTTP body) only when Lightning Address is a non-empty trimmed
string, `spendPing` is set, **and** the caller has a live living-room
top-level post (not the profile note) whose `createdAt` is on the same
UTC day. No such post → **200**, no ping, log `spend.ping.skipped` /
`no_public_post`. Ping throw still **200**. Living-room lookup failure
after persist is still **200**, no ping, log `spend.ping.skipped` /
`posted_unreachable`. Empty or invalid text is
**400** and does not ping. Founder / verified / basis **404** on that id.

Same 401 / 400 text / 404 / 503 shapes as the list/get routes, plus
**400** `{ "error": "Set a name before posting" }` when the sending member
has no display name.

Success → **Response** `200` (one public conversation message, including
optional sender `accountId`).

### `POST /conversations/:id/invoice`

Bearer session required. Body `{ "sats": <int 1..10_000_000>, "text"?: "<string>" }`.
Optional `text` is the NIP-57 comment (empty = gift-only). Issues a BOLT11
against the counterpart's Lightning Address using their profile-note event
id as the zap `e` tag. The conversation row is **not** inserted until the
zap receipt is ingested.

Success → **Response** `200`:

```json
{ "pr": "lnbc…", "amountSats": 21, "messageId": "<uuid>" }
```

`messageId` is the predetermined conversation message id. Poll
`GET /conversations/:id?sinceMessageId=` until it appears.

**400** `{ "error": "The author's wallet cannot receive this Bitcoin payment" }`
for Damus threads, missing counterpart LN / profile event, LNURL `noZap`, or a
non-NIP-57 invoice. **400** `{ "error": "Could not start the Bitcoin payment" }`
when LNURL is unreachable or another transport failure. **400**
`{ "error": "Cannot message yourself" }`. **429** Too many payments. **503**
`{ "error": "Messages are unavailable" }` without a KEK. **503**
`{ "error": "Conversations are unavailable" }` when the ok-path
`recordInvoiceAttempt` throws after a successful LNURL mint (no `pr` in the
response).

### `GET /notifications`

Bearer session required. Lists the recipient's notifications newest-first
(cap **200**) plus the total unread count (not the page length). Fan-out
already applied the owner's `notificationLevel` when the row was written;
this list returns stored rows unfiltered. Each item `type` is
`"forum_post"`, `"forum_reply"`, `"zap"`, or `"moderator_appointed"`. Member
JSON never includes recipient or actor account ids.

Missing/invalid/expired bearer → **Response** `401`:

```json
{ "error": "Unauthorized" }
```

Store failure → **Response** `503`:

```json
{ "error": "Notifications are unavailable" }
```

Success → **Response** `200`:

```json
{
  "notifications": [
    {
      "id": "<uuid>",
      "type": "forum_reply",
      "parentId": "<uuid>",
      "replyId": "<uuid>",
      "name": "Bob",
      "text": "bob reply",
      "createdAt": "2026-09-12T12:00:00.000Z",
      "readAt": null
    }
  ],
  "unreadCount": 1
}
```

`unreadCount` is the total unread, not the page length.

### `POST /notifications/read-all`

Bearer session required. Marks every unread notification for the session
account read.

Missing/invalid/expired bearer → **401** `{ "error": "Unauthorized" }`.
Store failure → **503** `{ "error": "Notifications are unavailable" }`.

Success → **Response** `200`:

```json
{ "ok": true }
```

### `POST /notifications/:id/read`

Bearer session required. `:id` is a UUID. Marks one notification read and
returns that `PublicNotification` with `readAt` set. Unknown id, another
account's notification, or a non-uuid `:id` → **404**
`{ "error": "Not found" }`. Same **401** / **503** as list.

Success → **Response** `200` (one public notification with `readAt` set).

## Not implemented (v1, decided in CONCEPT — no HTTP paths)

The following are decided product capabilities for v1 (see `CONCEPT.md`) but
are **not** exposed as HTTP routes in this codebase yet. Paths and JSON for
these land in the PR that implements them; this file is updated then. Do not
treat the list below as inventing endpoints.

**Donor LNDHub credentials.** Paying uses lightning.space LNDHub in the
external spend worker, not encrypted storage in this api. No `/me/donor`
deposit route.

**Recurring gifts.** Donors will configure fixed USD amounts to
recipients. They are paid by the external spend worker **when the recipient
posts a top-level note**, not on a daily timer. Invoice HTTP (`POST /invoices`
/ `POST /invoices/proof`) is unchanged except proof now attaches a gift-reply
when `messageId` was stored; do not invent new paths. No `/me/recurring` or
in-process scheduler.

**Feed / discovery / campaign index.** Paginated read endpoints over indexed
NOSTR events (profiles, campaigns, replies). Not wired yet. Custodial nsec
and server-side kind:1 / zap signing ship in this version (KEK + worker).

**Readiness probe.** `/healthz` remains liveness-only. A readiness check of
downstream dependencies is still planned. The LUD-16 metadata cache on
`GET /lightning-address` is in-memory only. Gift statistics read Postgres
when `DATABASE_URL` is set.

**Moderator-only endpoints.** Soft-hide is implemented as
`DELETE /messages/:id` (founder/moderator session). The staff hidden log
is implemented as `GET /messages/hidden` (founder/moderator **session**,
not `DEBUG_TOKEN`; registered before `GET /messages/:id`). Operator debug
restore exists as `POST /debug/messages/:id/restore` (`DEBUG_TOKEN`).
Staff / moderator session unhide is still not a route. Other Moderator
actions are not HTTP routes yet. Role values
exist on the account model; `GET /debug/accounts` and
`PATCH /debug/accounts/:id` are operator token routes, not a moderator session.

---

## Out of scope for v1

- Passkey + PRF + NIP-06 user-owned keys (non-custodial phase)
- Email/password login (or any second login method)
- Internationalization of the api (responses and push payloads stay English; visitor-UI locales live in the app catalog)
- Platform custody of **receiver** funds (receiving stays LUD-16 only)
- Arbitrary LNDHub URLs (the external spend worker uses lightning.space only)
