## How to read this file

| Label       | Meaning                                                                                |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Shipped** | Exists in `21gifts/app` and/or this api today; HTTP only as already named in `SPEC.md` |
| **Sketch**  | Decided v1 UX from `CONCEPT.md`; no UI and no HTTP yet. Headings here are not routes.  |

Users are never asked about keys, relays, or NOSTR jargon on any screen. The
product stays warm and direct — people helping people.

## 1. Sign-in — **Shipped**

The landing page at `/` is the marketing site (pitch, how-it-works, FAQ) with
**Log in** / **Ask for help** to `/login` and **Send help** to `/donate`.
`/login` is the passkey-only sign-in surface (`LoginCard`). Passkey RP ID is
`WEBAUTHN_RP_ID`.

On mount the app rehydrates a persisted session token via `GET /me`. A **401**
clears the token; a transient failure does not.

**Passkey (first login, HTTP shipped)**

1. App calls `POST /auth/passkey/register/begin` (new account, or
   `{ "viewKey" }` to claim a provisioned profile) or
   `POST /auth/passkey/authenticate/begin` (returning).
2. Browser runs `navigator.credentials.create` / `get` with the returned
   `options` (no WebAuthn library in the app).
3. App posts the credential to the matching `…/finish` with the page
   `Origin`. The api verifies and returns `{ token, account }` immediately.

Login is passkey-only. LNURL-auth has been removed.

The signed-in view currently lives on `/login` — there is no separate
`/profile` route yet. It shows a name form, a Lightning Address form, and
**Sign out**. Name and Lightning Address are each skippable via
`POST /me/setup/skip`; living-room rules stay required.

After name/skip and address/skip, the app records living-room rules agreement
via `POST /me/rules-agreement`. `GET /me` carries `setup` (wizard; skip counts
as done), `missing` (facts; skip does not), and `rulesAgreedAt` (epoch ms of
the first agreement, or `null`).

No email, no password. Losing the passkey (and platform sync) loses the
account.

HTTP cited: `/auth/passkey/register/begin`, `/auth/passkey/register/finish`,
`/auth/passkey/authenticate/begin`, `/auth/passkey/authenticate/finish`,
`/me`, `/me/setup/skip`, `/me/name`, `/me/rules-agreement`.

---

## 2. Profile — **Shipped** (address, name) + **Sketch** (photo / story)

### Address — **Shipped**

Every account can receive. From the signed-in view the user can link, replace,
or unlink a LUD-16 Lightning Address:

- `POST /me/lightning-address` — link or replace after a live well-known
  resolve that requires zap metadata (`allowsNostr` + `nostrPubkey`). Always
  leaves the address **unverified**. Unreachable or non-zap addresses are
  rejected and not stored.
- `DELETE /me/lightning-address` — unlink (also clears the LN skip timestamp
  so `setup` returns to `lightning-address` when a name is set or name-skipped)

Proof-of-control of the linked Lightning Address is the flag
`lightningAddressVerified` (not the forum role **Verified**):

1. `POST /me/lightning-address/verification` (no body). The api pays 1 sat, or
   the provider's `minSendable` when higher, capped at 10 sat, with a LUD-12
   comment `21gifts <32-hex-nonce>`. The nonce is never returned to the client.
2. The user types the code from wallet history into
   `POST /me/lightning-address/verification/confirm`.

Until an invoice payer is injected, start returns **503**
`{ "error": "Verification payments are not configured" }`. The process still
boots. Live verification payments do **not** work today. Edit or unlink clears
any pending verification (`SPEC.md`).

### Identity copy — **Shipped** (name / location / About me / About me photo)

Receiver name is stored on the account (`POST /me/name`). Optional free-text
location is stored on the account (`POST /me/location`); empty or whitespace
after trim stores `null`. Location is public on member and view cards. It is
not a setup step, not a posting requirement, not a profile forum note, and
not Nostr `kind:0`. About me is `PUT /me/about` (Bearer `{ text, photo? }`): a
non-blank name is required (409 otherwise); Lightning Address is not; empty
text clears the bio (`aboutMe` null; a live note row is kept). Optional
`photo` uses the same JPEG/PNG/WebP decode as a forum post (`omitted` keeps,
`null` clears, object sets). When no live note exists, empty text without a
new photo does not create or notify; a photo-only or non-empty write against
a missing or hidden note creates a live note without LN and notifies after
the write. Auto name-copy is not a bio (`aboutMe` is `null`); a photo still
sets `aboutMeHasPhoto`. `POST /me/name` still no-ops the note without LN;
`POST /me/lightning-address` still creates the name-copy note. Rename does
not create a second note. Other members read live identity plus `aboutMe`
and `aboutMeHasPhoto` via `GET /members/:accountId` (Bearer; rules required).
Kind:0 `picture` stays the brand icon. **Do not invent** `POST /me/profile`.

### View-key link — **Shipped**

The owner can copy a view-key link from `viewKey` on `GET /me`. The URL is
`GET /view/:viewKey`. Opening that URL shows a read-only public profile card.
It cannot write and cannot mint a session. Do not invent extra paths.

---

## 3. Donate — **Sketch** (button / browser pay) + **Shipped** (resolve)

Guest / one-off giving: the donor clicks **Donate** on a receiver and pays
through browser LNURL-pay (resolve the Lightning Address → invoice → wallet
pays). The api is **not** in the payment path. This works without an account
(CONCEPT Donations).

Public `GET /lightning-address` now resolves and caches LUD-16 metadata
(callback, min/max sendable, optional commentAllowed). There is still no
Donate button; for this guest path the api still does not fetch or pay the
gift invoice (spend-worker invoice fetch is §4 / `POST /invoices`).

There is no campaign feed and no Donate button in the app today. Do not invent
`/feed` or `/campaigns` paths.

HTTP cited: `/lightning-address`, `/gifts/stats`, `/gifts?day=` (see `SPEC.md`).

Public gift totals are **Shipped** as `GET /gifts/stats` (sats, BTC,
historical USD at each gift's UTC-day Coinbase BTC-USD close, and
CHF/EUR/PHP = USD × that UTC day's ECB rate, last business day if closed;
UTC spend-over-time, per person, per month). Individual gifts for one UTC day
are **Shipped** as `GET /gifts?day=YYYY-MM-DD`. No invoices. The app
statistics page and `/stats/{day}` consume those routes.

Optional NIP-57 Zap receipts stay deferred (CONCEPT Out).

---

## 4. Recurring gifts — **Sketch**

**Prerequisite**: paying is out of this process. The external spend
worker holds lightning.space LNDHub credentials and calls:

1. `POST /invoices` — this api fetches the BOLT11 from the recipient via LNURL-pay
2. LNDHub `payinvoice` (spend, not this api)
3. `POST /invoices/proof` — preimage (`sha256` = payment hash); the api records the gift for `GET /gifts/stats` and `GET /gifts?day=`. After recording the gift, when the invoice has `messageId` the api inserts a platform-account gift-reply under a top-level post first, then `addSats`. When `messageId` is already a reply, it hides a deterministic spend marker and `addSats`s that reply (no nested gift-reply)

Recurring **USD** gifts are paid by the external spend worker **when the
recipient posts a top-level note**, not on a daily timer. Invoice HTTP
(`POST /invoices` / `POST /invoices/proof`) is unchanged. Recurring donor UI
is still a sketch. **Do not invent** `/me/donor`, `/me/recurring`, or
scheduler paths. HTTP that exists today is only the spend-worker invoice
pair above (`SPEC.md`).

---

## 5. Message — **Shipped**

Public comment / encouragement is a v1 surface. The composer POSTs
`{ text }` and/or `{ photo: { contentType, data } }` to `POST /messages`
(requires rules + name + Lightning Address — missing requirements are
**409** `missing_requirements`);
a **new top-level** persist pings spend (`POST {SPEND_URL}/ping` with
`{ address, messageId }` and Bearer `SPEND_API_TOKEN`); replies and media replay do
not ping; unset/blank env skips the ping and still returns 200;
the public thread is listed via `GET /messages` (requires rules; newest first, name
snapshotted at post, `sats`, `payable`, `hasPhoto`, and live author `role`
— never photo bytes). Bytes are public `GET /messages/:id/photo` (Nostr `imeta`). Staff hide is a public-API filter only; operator `GET /debug/messages` (Bearer `DEBUG_TOKEN`) still lists and fetches soft-hidden forum rows and their photo bytes. The shipped UI
is a messenger-group thread: oldest notes at the top, newest at the bottom,
composer under the newest note. The welcome-forum living-room laws hint is
dismissed via `POST /me/forum-laws-dismissed`. Posts are standalone kind:1
notes (Damus-visible `#bitcoin` / `#21gifts` in content on first sign, plus `#<locationHashtagName>` and a `t` tag when account `location` is non-null (not on the profile note, not kind:0); forum `text` unchanged; pending notes EVENT before any hashtag/photo re-sign so the sign lease cannot starve fan-out);
the worker fans out when `NOSTR_PUBLISH=1`. Pay-on-note is
`POST /messages/:id/invoice` (optional `text` becomes the zap comment). After a
validated kind:9735 is indexed, a payer gift-reply is inserted only when the
paid row is top-level (`parentId` null). A zap on a signed reply credits that
reply and does not nest a gift-reply. Gift-only (empty text) replies are not published to Nostr. Unpaid
replies from `basis` (not the parent author) are **403**; `verified` /
`moderator` / `founder` stay unpaid-reply exempt. Do not invent `/events` or `/comments` paths.

Private messaging ships as one PN channel: `GET/POST /conversations` plus
member→platform via `POST /contact`. NIP-17 gift wraps and legacy kind:4
inbound; outbound wraps with the sender nsec (platform nsec for staff on
official threads). Forum replies stay on `/messages` and are not mixed
with PNs. Lightning gifts in a Direct/Contact thread use
`POST /conversations/:id/invoice` (`{ sats, text? }`). Payment is confirmed
when a matching zap receipt is ingested: the api appends a conversation
message (`text` + `sats`, or empty `text` with `sats` only) and does **not**
credit the counterpart's profile note or insert a forum gift-reply.
`GET /conversations/:id?sinceMessageId=` long-polls until that predetermined
row exists. Damus threads cannot be invoiced.

---

## 6. Contact — **Shipped**

Private mailbox so members can write to 21.gifts without a published email.
Signed-in members POST `{ text }` to `POST /contact` (name snapshot as
forum messages; `normalizeForumText` plus a required 1–500 character body —
forum photo-only empty text does not apply). After the platform account
exists, the contact row is persisted first, then the same text is appended
to the member→platform conversation thread (`GET /conversations`).
Conversation append failure logs `conversations.contact_sync.failed` and
still 200. No platform account → 503 `Platform account is not configured`
(no writes). Operators still read
the legacy mailbox via `GET /debug/contacts` (`DEBUG_TOKEN` must not read
member PNs). No public list, no email delivery. Do not invent `/events`.

---

## 7. Notifications — **Shipped**

Transactional Web Push for signed-in members. The app is installable
(Web App Manifest + service worker). After login the profile card has an
icon-only bell: enable asks the OS permission, then `POST /me/push-subscriptions`.
Disable `DELETE`s the endpoint. `GET /push/vapid-public` is Bearer.

On iPhone Safari the site must be on the Home Screen before the OS will
deliver pushes; the app shows that hint. Android and desktop Chrome do
not need the icon.

The api writes one in-app row to every account except the actor, then
filters recipients by each account's `notificationLevel`, and
enqueues (does not send inline) one Web Push to every remaining bell subscriber
(an account with at least one `push_subscription`) except the actor:

- a **forum post** payload when someone else posts (`title` New post on 21.gifts, `url: /notifications`, `tag: forum_post:<postId>`)
- a **reply** payload when someone replies (`title` New reply on 21.gifts, `url: /notifications`, `tag: forum_reply:<replyId>`). Damus-only parents still fan out; a self-reply skips only the actor. That includes an unpaid `POST /messages` reply and an inbound member reply the worker persisted.
- a **zap** payload when a zap receipt is newly indexed (`title` Bitcoin on 21.gifts, `body` Someone sent sats., `url: /notifications`, `tag: zap:<id>`). The note author is notified unless they are the payer.

Missing `pushStore` still writes in-app rows. If persist or enqueue
fails, the living-room write still succeeds (HTTP 200 on `POST /messages`;
worker paths log and keep the row).

The in-app Notifications list (`GET /notifications`, mark-read POSTs) is
separate from `/conversations` chat. Post, reply, and zap pushes open
`/notifications`.

The worker sends when VAPID is configured. On outbox retry it does not re-send
an endpoint that already succeeded for that outbox row. Open focused tabs skip
a second banner (service worker). Owners set one of three levels via POST /me/notification-level (`all` default = current behaviour; `active` = related top-level post sats>0, zaps also when amountSats>0; `mentions` = staff/platform actor or reply/zap on the recipient's own note). Filter applies to in-app and Web Push. GET /notifications lists stored rows unfiltered.

HTTP cited: `/push/vapid-public`, `/me/push-subscriptions`, `/me/notification-level`, `/debug/push-ping`,
`/notifications`, `/notifications/read-all`, `/notifications/:id/read`.
